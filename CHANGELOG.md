# Changelog

All notable changes to Mozaiks are tracked here.

This project follows a practical pre-1.0 changelog format:

- `Added` for new capabilities
- `Changed` for behavior, docs, packaging, or workflow changes
- `Fixed` for bug fixes
- `Removed` for removed behavior
- `Security` for vulnerability or hardening work

## Unreleased

### Added

- Optional bounded `actions[].timeout_seconds` for async module actions, validated
  through AppGenerator and runtime registration. Ordinary actions keep their
  existing default; caller payloads cannot override the registered budget.

- Reusable Android delivery of canonical app workspaces through
  `mozaiks package android`, with a declared mobile build-context pack,
  deterministic source/tooling archives, and debug APK build receipts.

- Optional native browser navigation for the shared OIDC adapter, with an
  Android Common Ground reference and authenticated emulator acceptance workflow.

- An experimental Capacitor Android packaging reference for Common Ground,
  with web-asset verification, a diagnostic debug APK build in CI, and explicit
  native integration prerequisites.

- Common Ground, a responsive community reference with posts, comments,
  reactions and author-controlled deletion, plus reproducible local acceptance
  against the platform host, MongoDB and OIDC sign-in.

- A host's `module_scope_resolver` hook can return `verified_tenant_id`, beside
  `verified_workspace_id`, to assert a tenant it verified from the authenticated
  caller's memberships. Module entitlement checks then use that tenant, so a
  host that keeps its own tenant ids can make tenant-level plans apply to its
  members. Omitting it keeps the tenant the token is bound to; an explicit
  `None` removes it. A plain `tenant_id` from the hook or the request remains
  dispatch metadata and never selects a plan. Stored documents, ownership,
  account export and delete, and dispatch audit records are unchanged. HTTP and
  admin module dispatch, workflow tools, Page Ask and profile hydration all
  honor it.

### Security

- Code review loads Monaco and its workers locally, using the patched DOMPurify
  dependency for editor markup with sanitizer hooks isolated from chat rendering.

- Patched DOMPurify and source-map-js in the shipped frontend dependency locks,
  including Monaco's nested DOMPurify dependency.

- Shared authenticated fetches now resolve relative backend URLs consistently
  and restrict automatic bearer-token injection to the configured backend origin.

- Social `user_posts` listings and per-post reads, comments, and reactions now
  enforce published-public-or-author visibility. Caller filters cannot expose
  another member's private or friends-only records; friends-based sharing remains
  unsupported. Common Ground uses the same canonical backend repair.

- Updated the AG2 runtime dependency from `1.0.5` to `1.1.2` for every AG2
  extra. Mozaiks pins AG2 exactly, so installations could not take upstream
  fixes on their own. AG2 `1.0.5` is affected by eight AG2 security advisories,
  all fixed in `1.1.2`; `1.1.1` is still affected by the first two below.
  Mozaiks' own code is not exposed to any of them:
  - GHSA-42mf-vpmr-gw5r (critical, fixed in `1.1.2`): `blocked` and `ignore`
    command filters on the local shell could be bypassed. Mozaiks attaches
    `SandboxShellTool` with no filter, so there is none to bypass. That tool,
    used by six AppGenerator agents, is an unrestricted shell on the host by
    design.
  - GHSA-3ccw-g7ph-hrcr (high, fixed in `1.1.2`): a network-served AG2 Hub did
    not bind control operations to the authenticated connection. Mozaiks runs
    its Hub in process only.
  - GHSA-2h4w-29cv-2cmv (high, fixed in `1.1.1`): newline injection bypassed
    `SandboxShellTool`'s `allowed` and `readonly` options. Mozaiks sets neither.
  - GHSA-rppm-w5cw-6qcg (medium, fixed in `1.1.1`): tool approval and dispatch
    were keyed by name, so two tools with one name both ran. Mozaiks uses no
    approval middleware, and no shipped workflow gives an agent two tools with
    one name.
  - GHSA-hf3x-42qp-4rq6 (high, fixed in `1.1.0`): path traversal in skill
    archive installation. Mozaiks never installs skills.
  - GHSA-qrjx-72xx-xhmh (high, fixed in `1.1.0`): path traversal in
    `DiskKnowledgeStore`, which Mozaiks does not use.
  - GHSA-fxhh-6rm2-v2pp (medium, fixed in `1.1.0`): `FilesystemToolkit` listed
    files outside its base path. Mozaiks does not use it.
  - GHSA-2h3q-9p6m-4hm4 (medium, fixed in `1.1.0`): subtasks shared their
    parent's tool-approval state. Mozaiks uses no subtasks or approval
    middleware.

- JWT and Keycloak authentication now require an audience at startup and
  verify it and an access-token type on every bearer token (`AUTH_AUDIENCE` for JWT,
  `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` for Keycloak). Deployments that left these unset must
  configure them; local runs with `AUTH_ENABLED=false` are unaffected. The
  unused JWT validator was removed (#523).
  Generated authenticated deployment manifests and env templates now mark the
  matching audience setting as required. Bundle validation rejects deployment
  artifacts that omit or downgrade those requirements.
  The local Keycloak realm uses a distinct `mozaiks-api` audience, and existing
  persistent realms can add that client and mapper without deleting data.

- The package no longer exports `create_mozaiks_app` or ships
  `mozaiksai.factory`. The sub-application it built served a chat-start route
  and a WebSocket that did not check sign-in, whatever the auth settings said.
  Run one of the hosts instead (`mozaiks serve`, with `--host runtime`,
  `platform` or `studio`); each authenticates through the configured adapter.
  The setup guide now describes running a host beside an existing backend
  rather than mounting one inside it.

- HTTP routes no longer accept a bearer token in an `?access_token=` query
  parameter; send it in the `Authorization` header. Tokens in URLs end up in
  logs and browser history. The WebSocket opt-in
  `MOZAIKS_WS_ALLOW_QUERY_TOKEN` is unchanged and still covers only the
  handshake.

- E2B preview template uploads exclude local environment files, dependencies,
  caches, browser reports, and runtime log output.

- Bounded module collection handles now accept only the arguments the installed
  MongoDB driver defines for each operation. Previously the handle passed a
  caller's keyword and positional arguments straight to the driver, which passes
  a keyword it does not recognize into the server command it builds; an
  unchecked argument, or a raw query command envelope in a read filter, could
  change what that command addressed, so an app running beside owner-scoped
  collections could reach data outside its boundary. Each method now takes its
  primary arguments (filter, update, document, pipeline and so on) by position
  or by the driver's keyword, never both, plus only the options the driver
  defines for that operation, and refuses anything else before the driver
  builds a command. Every option that existing callers in this repository and
  its factory templates pass is still accepted. An option the driver does not
  define for an operation is now refused even where the server would accept it,
  for example `hint` on an aggregation or `let` on a count. Aggregation
  pipelines, on bounded handles and on owner-scoped collections, are copied
  once into plain documents (a stage that is not a document, or a key that is
  not a string, is refused), and that copy is both what the stage validator
  checks and what the driver sends. Which collections a handle may open and
  which aggregation stages are allowed are unchanged. Bounded handles prevent
  mistakes; they are not a sandbox against hostile code running in the host
  process.

- Self-hosted subscription grant and revoke actions are internal-only; HTTP
  callers cannot assign themselves paid entitlements.

- An app workspace without its own `workflows/` folder now serves no
  workflows. Hosts other than Studio previously fell back to the packaged
  Factory workflows for such an app, so a generated app's container loaded
  them. Studio still serves the Factory workflows, an app with its own
  `workflows/` serves those, and an app registry that extends
  `mozaiks.default_workflow_registry` still resolves the default workflows.
  `/api/health` now reports workflow counts only, without workflow names,
  handler metadata or filesystem paths, and the platform host answers 404, not
  503, when a chat is started for a workflow it does not serve.

- Runtime persistence enforces declared user/workspace ownership for every
  module read, write, and aggregation using authenticated identity. Inserts
  stamp the declared owner field and reject conflicting values; client-selected
  workspace IDs and model-authored repository code cannot bypass ownership.
  Cached handles resolve current dispatch authority; declared entity references
  resolve to the owned collection. Generated owned apps require auth and reject
  private persistence/raw-client escapes before admission. Local development and
  Page Ask retain scoped access; verified host membership can resolve workspace
  authority. Mixed apps keep unowned alias operations through a bounded facade.

- Generated collection tenancy, owner fields, and entity identities are decided
  in DesignDocs and preserved through generation and repair. Canonical reads
  require login and owner filtering for user/workspace data, with deterministic
  backend implementations. Subscription gates target approved writes and custom
  reads, survive repairs, and cannot lock canonical reads or billing facades.

- Generated apps get code-owned canonical `create_<entity>`,
  `update_<entity>` and `delete_<entity>` actions, a code-rendered
  `backend/schemas.py` and handler/service/repo implementations for every
  module-written collection, compiled from the approved data contract. Create
  assigns the declared id and timestamps, update and delete address records by
  that id and answer 404 outside the caller's scope, and the runtime stamps
  ownership. Canonical actions carry no role permissions: authored permissions on
  owner-scoped actions are removed with a logged normalization and rejected on
  app-wide collections. Unique indexes on owned collections are compounded with
  the owner field. ServiceAgent now writes only write hooks, custom mutations and
  custom reads; ModelAgent no longer authors schemas for persistent modules.
  App-wide collections beside gated, permissioned or internal actions get no open
  canonical writes; hooks are validated at task admission and may return None;
  DesignDocs validates canonical field types and defaults at save time and gives
  required array/object fields an empty default; the generated record id is
  `<entity>_id`, never a natural `search_by` key.
- A host running without authentication gives development access (the
  anonymous user's roles, dev personas, trusted module dispatch, acting for
  other users) only to requests from its own machine by default. A request
  counts as local only when it comes straight from a loopback address with no
  forwarding header, its `Host` and `Origin` (when present) name this machine,
  and, without an `Origin`, fetch metadata does not mark it as cross-site, so
  pages on other websites cannot use a local browser that sends fetch metadata
  to get development access (see the authentication setup guide). Other
  requests get no development access: routes that need an identity refuse
  them, and routes that need none serve them as requests without credentials.
  The web shell's dev proxy marks requests from other machines, so the backend
  treats them the same way. Open local apps at `http://localhost:<port>` or
  `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`. A container reached through a published port needs
  `AUTH_ANON_ACCESS=open`, with the port published on `127.0.0.1` only (see the
  self-hosting guide). Rebuild `mozaiks-sandbox:local` and any E2B preview
  template from this release so previews pick up the change.
- A host with no authentication configuration at all no longer starts in an
  implicit demo mode. It refuses to start and names the choices: configure an
  identity provider, set `AUTH_ENABLED=false` (this machine only), or set
  `AUTH_ANON_ACCESS=public`. `mozaiks serve` and `mozaiks studio --open` refuse
  the same configurations before anything starts, and also refuse
  `AUTH_ANON_ACCESS=local` on a `--listen` address other machines can reach.
- Anonymous visitors of a public app (`AUTH_ANON_ACCESS=public`) and app
  previews run without development access: no roles, only `AUTH_ANON_SCOPES`
  (or `access_as_user`), their own user id only, and module permissions and
  entitlement gates enforced. Visitors share one identity: they see and
  change each other's chats and per-user records, and their entitlement gates
  are checked against it. They get no admin, Studio
  management or billing fulfillment access, and the programmatic workflow
  trigger needs an internal API key for them.
- With authentication on, a validated token whose subject is literally
  `anonymous` acts only as itself. It no longer names the user a request acts
  for or sees other owners' chats and sessions; only the development identity
  of a host without authentication does.

- Module entitlement gates are keyed only by the caller's verified identity:
  the token's user, the tenant the token is bound to, and the workspace the
  token or a host-verified membership assertion binds. A tenant or workspace
  selected by the request no longer chooses which plan applies, so a signed-in
  caller cannot use a plan held by a tenant or workspace their token is not
  bound to. Dispatch without a verified identity holds only app-wide grants.
  Apps that sell tenant- or workspace-scoped plans need tokens that carry the
  tenant (`AUTH_TENANT_ID_CLAIM`) or workspace (`AUTH_WORKSPACE_ID_CLAIM`) claim.

### Changed

- Workflow context declarations reject keys that start with `ag:` or `a2a:`:
  `context_variables.yaml` definitions and agent views, and `tools.yaml`
  outcome keys. AG2 reserves those prefixes and drops such keys from A2A,
  AG-UI, A2UI, and NLIP transports, so a declared key passed validation and
  then never reached a remote agent. No shipped workflow uses either prefix.
- Studio concept and app review screens put the decision before supporting details.
  The default workspace uses readable body text and quieter panels while retaining
  the Mozaiks wordmark; generated previews keep their own app branding.
- Submitting concept feedback immediately generates a new reviewable draft;
  the revised concept still requires explicit approval. Design failures retain
  their concrete rejection details when bounded retries end.
- Domain data assigned a reserved platform-authentication surface identifier
  receives explicit rename guidance before any ownership reassignment.
  Chat working indicators now include visible, accessible status text.
- New-app entry creates an owned Studio draft before launching the build journey.
  Transition preflight resolves that target without creating or resuming a run.
- Export and activation require completed acceptance and app-build validation.
  Restore and activation verify the owned archive's identity and digest before
  using it. Skipped checks and records without completed validation cannot certify a release.
- Artifact preview ownership and capacity now persist in MongoDB across Studio
  workers and restarts. Preview allocation uses a bounded queue and positive
  shared limits; interrupted updates require cleanup before reuse. Operators
  must replace former zero/unlimited sandbox limits before upgrading.
- The shared app directory supports controlled search, filters, and server
  pagination for management apps with larger portfolios.

- App previews are labeled as temporary drafts, show the selected version, and
  offer an explicit **Open draft preview** action that keeps the build workspace open.
  A persistent draft indicator also identifies previews opened in a separate tab.

- Hosted apps can reuse the Studio app directory and dashboard while keeping
  management routes separate from Factory build identities.

- Importing `mozaiksai` no longer reads a `.env` file (#778).
  `mozaiksai.core.core_config` used to call `load_dotenv()` on import, which
  searched upward from the installed package (or the working directory) and set
  every variable missing from the process. A release run unset
  `MOZAIKS_FACTORY_APP_PATH` on purpose; a later lazy import put it back from an
  enclosing project's `.env` and the run built from a stale checkout.
  Configuration now comes from the process environment, loaded explicitly at the
  entry point and never overriding a variable that is already set:
  - `mozaiks serve`, Studio launches (`studio --open`, `onboard`,
    `quickstart`), `gen`, `migrations status` and `context index` load the
    `.env` of the workspace they operate on (the workspace or `--dir`
    argument, or the current directory for `gen` and `migrations`). `gen`,
    `migrations`, `context` and the quickstart environment warnings did not
    load one explicitly before.
  - A direct `uvicorn mozaiksai.hosts.<host>:app` launch reads no `.env`. Pass
    `--env-file .env` or set the variables in the shell. `scripts/run-backend.ps1`,
    `start-dev.ps1` and the `scripts/run-backend.ps1` that `mozaiks init`
    scaffolds now pass `--env-file` when the `.env` exists.
  - App-local hosts that compose `mozaiksai.hosts.studio` (App Zero) must load
    their own `.env` in their launcher before upgrading. See
    `docs/architecture/hosts/host-composition-contract.md`.
  - `PYTHON_DOTENV_DISABLED=1` also prevents Studio launchers from copying
    workspace `.env` values into their child process.

- Replaced the default brand fonts with redistributable Bungee Inline and Share
  Tech, included the OFL text for Oxanium, and added package checks for bundled
  font licenses.

- Generated subscription plans now select approved module actions from a closed
  inventory. The factory derives capability IDs and gates only for actions that
  differ between plans, so actions included in every plan remain available after
  cancellation. Workflow features cannot be sold until workflow launch checks
  plan grants (#770). Usage limits are display-only and do not cap dispatch or
  consumption yet (#770); unavailable selections receive valid choices and a
  removal path.
- Setup docs now state the real Node.js requirement, 20.19+ or 22.12+ (Vite 8),
  instead of 18+. The README and `web_shell/README.md` show macOS / Linux
  commands next to the PowerShell ones. `pip install -e ".[docs]"` with
  `python -m mkdocs serve` is the one documented docs recipe. CONTRIBUTING
  documents the ruff and mypy commands CI runs. The CLI reference covers every
  command, with sample output taken from real runs.
- Setup docs no longer present Gemini as the default provider: builds call
  OpenAI only today, so they ask for `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The manual `web_shell`
  commands bind `127.0.0.1`. The subscriptions and entitlement guides now say
  that gates apply only with authentication on, that `assignment_store` needs
  `user_id_field: user_id` for per-user plans and a data alias declared in
  `data/contract.json`, and give a `reactions.yaml` example that loads.
- New setting `AUTH_ANON_ACCESS` (`local`, `public` or `open`) decides whom a
  host without authentication serves. `local` is the default once
  authentication is explicitly off. `public` serves every client as an
  anonymous visitor without development access; Studio refuses it, and it
  cannot be combined with `AUTH_ANON_ROLES`. `open` gives every client that can
  connect development access, and the host logs a warning at startup. Set on
  its own, `AUTH_ANON_ACCESS` turns authentication off unless a complete
  identity provider is configured, which turns it on. Unknown values are
  refused, and a deployed `ENV` (anything but the local names) still refuses
  every posture.
- Generated public apps declare `AUTH_ANON_ACCESS=public` in their `Dockerfile`
  (`ENV`), in every `.env*.example`, and in the deployment manifest
  (`auth.runtime_env`). Authenticated apps' artifacts are unchanged. Public
  bundles exported earlier must add `AUTH_ANON_ACCESS=public` to their
  environment before upgrading, or the host refuses to start.
- `infra/compose/docker-compose.yml` publishes the app port through
  `MOZAIKS_APP_PORTS` (unset: `8000:8000`, as before). To run the stack without
  authentication, set `AUTH_ENABLED=false`, `AUTH_ANON_ACCESS=open` and
  `MOZAIKS_APP_PORTS=127.0.0.1:8000:8000`. The repository's
  `scripts/run-backend.ps1` and `scripts/run-frontend.ps1` bind `127.0.0.1` by
  default; pass `-BindHost` to change it.
- Studio's integrations summary reports the authentication mode from the
  runtime's own auth resolution.

### Removed

- Unused refinement `coding.providers.acp.budget.max_retries` and LLM profile
  `default_temperature` settings. Configure provider retries and temperature in
  `llm_config`; obsolete fields now fail configuration validation. Removed the
  premature build-success metric emitted after classification and its orphaned
  logger, plus an unreachable duplicate artifact lookup branch.

### Fixed

- Pin shared-shell text checkouts to LF so installed Android framework resources
  have identical provenance on Windows and Linux. Binary assets stay unchanged.

- Android apps can use a separately registered public sign-in client on the
  same backend as the browser app. Native sign-in requires the configured
  Android profile and a callback matching the packaged application.

- Refinement confirmations ignore unbound nested actions and retain the original
  request, build and revision through ChatPage. Pending decisions normalize their
  stored representation before conditional consumption. Accept and reject verify
  app archives before mutating draft/session state, then reuse the verified bytes.
  Schema-page edits use the file identity independently of the display name;
  Workbench theme edits target the saved app bundle. Journeys without an explicit
  participation choice retain guided reviews.
- App-owned home pages now render at `/` through the existing authentication
  guard; apps without a declared home page retain the chat fallback.
- Saved app builds open the shared preview, refinement and review workbench
  directly from Studio. Version switches preserve preview cleanup and reject
  late results from a previously opened version. Parent refreshes preserve a
  newer draft's files and review evidence.
  Review-ready apps link directly to their saved builds without restarting a
  previous build conversation.
- Passive chat navigation starts only verified empty sessions. Saved execution,
  pending input, unreadable state or native AG2 state never triggers an automatic
  restart or synthetic reply; explicit user input keeps its existing route.
- Entire-app refinement asks the existing harness to propose file scope. Scope
  and workflow approvals are bound to the saved request, artifact and revision,
  then consumed once through the session store before continuing. Selected-file
  requests stop when the saved contracts cannot prove the requested write scope.
  Pending decisions preserve the current candidate's review evidence, and review
  actions wait until the submitted refinement finishes.
- Visual page refinement resolves the saved route and component registration to
  the existing page source. Its planner and worker validate finite surface/target
  pairs and the complete write scope before generation, retaining the route and
  registry as read-only context. Unknown, ambiguous and unsafe mappings fail
  before generating files; new surfaces require the broader workflow path.
- Refinements use the configured validation policy and automatic provider
  selection instead of forcing local builds or inheriting a previous build's
  local strategy. Saved review labels the starting version and keeps detailed
  change summaries expandable while showing failures and review actions.
- Studio drafts show the registered app's current build and approved description.
  The workbench opens on preview, keeps required continuation and review actions
  visible, and offers code, downloads, and diagnostics on demand. Historical chat
  messages no longer keep the typing indicator active after the run pauses.
  Warning details and review notes are expandable; failed and skipped checks
  remain visible, and complete warning lists stay accessible.
- Draft preview dependency installation works with the disposable image's Debian
  Python, retaining the sandbox user and pinned runtime dependency constraints.
  Failed previews preserve their original error until retry or dismissal.
- Scoped refinement preserves the three canonical exported environment templates;
  real credential files remain blocked and template values still pass deployment
  validation before acceptance.
- Generated apps receive their shared API helper before build validation. Preview
  requests default to the app's own origin, and frontend build errors enter the
  existing bounded repair path or finish with a failure explanation.
- Approved concept names now reach the existing Studio app registry through an
  owner- and build-scoped update, preserving manually assigned names, app identity,
  lifecycle and history. Unnamed builds retain readable draft labels in the app
  directory until approval; existing saved records are not renamed retroactively.
- Generated read actions retain Mongo `_id` when needed for record identity or
  lookup. Runtime smoke uses the approved get lookup key independently of the
  generated update/delete identity, preventing false rejection of valid natural
  keys while retaining record-identity and two-user isolation checks.
- Reopened failed workflows retain their declared failure explanation in a
  collapsed details panel beside the existing retry action. The metadata read
  keeps the session's user and app scope and exposes no other workflow context.
- App planning preserves the approved data-contract serializer when its task
  carries an unbound capability label. Planner, schema, and file guidance now
  agree on its existing structural identity; actual capability associations and
  extra file ownership remain subject to the normal approval checks.
- Failed initial-build retries retain the saved guided/autonomous choice while
  starting with fresh execution state. Invalid saved choices fail before launch.
- Bundle scanning resolves custom pages through their registered imports instead
  of guessing a filename from the component name. Missing bindings still fail.
- ServiceAgent guidance distinguishes the final backend file inventory from
  model-authored files, keeping generated policy code with its existing owner.
- Custom page task builds and standalone saves now share page-file validation
  and registry materialization. Model-authored registry files fail with guidance
  to preserve the approved page and let code generate its registration.
- Exhausted build repair reports the limit of automatic recovery without
  claiming the validation errors are impossible to fix.
- Studio shows working activity when an actual AG2 model call begins, including
  repeated calls by the same agent, without exposing hidden agent identities.
- Authenticated custom-page builds now recognize the exact sign-in and callback
  routes produced by the canonical auth scaffold. Unapproved custom routes still
  fail with repair guidance. Exhausted task recovery reports the assembly cause
  through the existing validation and failure path.
- Autonomous builds continue through validated no-subscription and no-workflow
  decisions without redundant approval cards, recording that review was not
  required. Nonempty decisions and final app activation retain their review gates.
- Generated handler repair feedback identifies the required workspace subclass.
  Design and UI guidance preserves mandatory persistence behavior, uses shipped
  table action APIs, and keeps side effects out of React state updaters.

- Studio clears working and typing indicators when a workflow asks for input
  or displays an interactive approval, keeping the user's next action clear.
- The activation response uses the same verified app archive as the activation
  itself, avoiding a second fetch or an error after a successful activation if
  the original archive changes.

- Scoped refinements now validate the complete edited app through the existing
  acceptance and build checks, save a canonical verified archive, and carry that
  candidate's evidence into Studio review. Operator execution policy wins over
  model hints; skipped checks cannot activate a draft. Cancelled validation
  finishes sandbox and disposable runtime-smoke cleanup.

- DesignDocs now declares each page's existing canonical rendering surface.
  App planning preserves it and uses the shared materializer for prompt paths,
  preventing an approved interactive custom page from becoming static YAML.
  Existing pre-production designs without the field must revisit DesignDocs.

- ValueEngine intake now records strict, bounded readiness through its auto tool
  instead of parsing a completion word from chat. Complete briefs proceed to
  research without another confirmation; concise product language replaces
  implementation jargon, while explicit concept approval remains required.

- Factory interviews use typed readiness and retain explicit brand preferences
  across workflow transitions. Custom interactive page plans now own their React
  files and shared route registry together, using the same deterministic registry
  renderer as standalone app saves.
- AG2 knowledge-store writes are serialized per session so a delayed earlier
  snapshot cannot overwrite the active channel state needed after restart.

- A copied `.env.example` now imports the hosts and points the local shell's
  API proxy at the backend; `mozaiks context index` passes its workspace key.
- Exported app requirements now pin Mozaiks to the version that built the app
  and omit imports supplied by the app's own root folders or Python files.

- Social post listing now lets scoped persistence supply app identity instead
  of rejecting a repeated app filter. Post-module response
  schemas also accept the nullable cursor, post and reaction values returned
  by the service. Account export and deletion use those same declared
  collections and reject a mismatched app or user; exports page through all
  matching records.
  Post and comment pages clamp requested limits to 99 so a request for 100
  still returns a cursor when more rows exist. The Common Ground reference
  builds its own JSX and runs eight desktop/phone browser checks in dedicated
  CI using disposable local MongoDB and Keycloak services.

- `dispatch_module_action` called without an `app` no longer imports the
  platform host as a side effect. On a serving runtime-only host that import
  could never complete: every call failed with "Cannot add middleware after an
  application has started" after writing platform state onto the live app. It
  now reports "Module runtime is not available." there, and still dispatches
  through the platform host whenever the process has composed one.

- A chat session created before its first run now starts when it receives
  its first message. It was treated as a run interrupted by a restart, and
  the resume failed because no run existed yet, so a first message sent to a
  newly started chat over HTTP failed without reaching a model.
  Persistence managers that outlive a host also bind the new process database
  client when the host is started again in the same process; a client the
  caller supplied is left in place.

- `scripts/run_live_workflow_smoke.py` runs on the runtime host
  (`mozaiksai.hosts.runtime`) with its real startup and shutdown, forcing an
  exit only when shutdown times out. It is the only launcher of its run, so
  the host does not also auto-start the session and the prompt and initial
  agent always arrive. With `AUTH_ENABLED=true` it needs a token for its user
  in `MOZAIKS_SMOKE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and stops with a clear error without one.

- Refinement completion now reflects validation and persistence outcomes.
  Failed or unverified drafts stay reviewable without replacing the active
  editor/preview; Review patch opens the saved candidate instead of running
  another coding request. Cancellation clears the matching in-progress session,
  and every coding provider passes the finalizer's approved-file scope check.
  A configured remote content-store failure now blocks saving the draft instead
  of silently claiming success with files available on only one worker.
- Required runtime checks that are skipped or unavailable leave generated-app
  acceptance pending. Partial source validation cannot pass, and exports require
  a passed build status plus acceptance for the exported snapshot. Acceptance smoke scripts run the
  canonical validator instead of injecting skipped build results.
- Existing-app discovery resumes the correct interview after human replies and
  completes only after its deterministic artifact save succeeds. Persistence
  failures terminate as failures instead of reporting successful discovery.
  Typed plan-recording tools now write the selected adoption path and reject
  artifact assembly that omits confirmed capability IDs.
- Workflow provider input retains the agent's prior replies after human
  confirmation and saved-channel reopen. A thin AG2 view adapter corrects the
  event shape consumed by provider mappers, preserving AG2 visibility and
  history limits; an upstream watchpoint defines when this adapter is removed.

- **`mozaiks add --preset <tier>` works** (#304). The command `mozaiks info`
  recommends always failed with "the following arguments are required:
  feature". `mozaiks add` now takes exactly one of a feature or
  `--preset {engine,chat,integrated,full}`: giving neither, both, or an
  unknown preset is a usage error (exit 2) that names the valid choices, and
  `app.json` is left untouched.
- **`mozaiks info`, `mozaiks add` and `mozaiks studio` exit 1 when they
  fail** (#305). A missing or unreadable `app.json`, a failed `app.json`
  write, and a workspace without a valid scaffold printed an error but exited
  0, so scripts and CI treated the failure as success. The printed messages
  are unchanged. An unknown preset does not reach these commands: the argument
  parser rejects it with exit 2.

- Fresh CLI scaffolds now boot from an installed wheel with a valid secret
  contract, stable app ID, and local Studio admin access. Local launchers bind
  loopback by default, report startup logs, fail fast on unreachable MongoDB,
  and route the frontend to the selected backend port. Release checks now
  smoke the installed app's first run.
  The MongoDB startup error shows `MONGO_URI` as its scheme, `***@` in place
  of credentials, the hosts and the database name; the query string is never
  shown. As long as the URI has the `@` that ends its credentials, no
  credential text is printed, whatever characters the password contains. A URI
  with a sign that it is malformed (an unescaped `@`, `/` or `?` in the
  password, options without the `/` that must follow the hosts, a
  percent-encoded host name), or that the driver rejects as malformed, prints
  as a placeholder. Next to credentials, a host with no dot and no port prints
  as `<host not shown>`, because the rest of a password reads the same way
  after an unescaped `@`; write its port (`mongo:27017`) to have it shown. The
  driver's own message is repeated only for a failed connection to hosts that
  are shown. When the driver refuses a well-formed URI, the error points at
  the DNS lookup of the shown host for `mongodb+srv://`, and at the URI's
  options otherwise, not at the password's encoding. Known limit: when that
  `@` is missing (an unquoted `.env` value cut at ` #` before it, or the wrong
  `@` percent-encoded), the value is a different URI, and credential text
  standing where its hosts and database name are read is still shown when it
  reads as an address: next to an `@`, one with a dot, a port or IPv6
  brackets; with no `@` left in the value, any host name.
  `mozaiks serve --listen <address>` and `mozaiks studio --open --listen
  <address>` on a non-loopback address with authentication off now print a
  warning to stderr before starting: the address; that anyone who can reach
  it can act as any user with any role, including admin; the roles of a
  request that claims no identity (`AUTH_ANON_ROLES`), which limit nothing;
  any identity-provider settings that `AUTH_ENABLED=false` or
  `AUTH_PROVIDER=none` overrides or that do not select a provider on their
  own; and how to turn authentication on. The host still starts, and
  `ENV=production` without authentication is still refused.
  The release docs and scripts ask for a throwaway MongoDB server, on a
  non-default port, for the first-run smoke: the runtime ignores the database
  name in `MONGO_URI` and uses fixed database names on that server
  (`mozaiksai` and `mozaiks_apps`, and `mozaiks_audit` for the audit records
  of module actions, such as those a Studio session runs).

- App fonts and colors declared in `theme_config.json` remain active when the
  standalone theme endpoint returns that same config. Only saved custom
  overrides for the matching app can replace them. Partial brand tokens inherit
  the app's light or dark appearance and font presets, keeping text and
  background colors consistent.

- Generated app plans and page manifests use the same finite auth choices.
  Public apps use `public`; invalid or retired labels such as `none` are
  rejected before they can accidentally enable login. Public auth cannot
  declare logical roles, and role-based auth must declare at least one role.

- A worker's Python that does not compile is now an output rejection the
  worker can correct, not a crash. A live run lost its `business_services` task
  to `invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma? (<unknown>, line 7)` as
  `execution_failed`, non-recoverable, with no candidate and nothing logged:
  the canonical read rendering parsed the model's handler/service/repo with no
  file name, and only a `ValueError` became a rejection. Batch recovery re-runs
  only recoverable rejections, so the task was never corrected and the bundle
  shipped without the model's `summarize_tasks`. Every model-authored `.py`
  file that ships as written is now compiled before code parses or rewrites
  it, and a failure, including `return` or `await` outside a function and
  source too deeply nested to compile, is rejected with one message per file,
  `<path>:<line>: <message>` and the offending line, keeping the candidate, so
  recovery gives the worker its one bounded correction. A copy code renders
  over (`policy.py`, `schemas.py`, `account_data_handler.py`) keeps its own
  rule, and a file the task does not own keeps the ownership message.
  Repository pruning, unused-import removal and emit-literal normalization
  keep the model's file unchanged and log `REPO_PRUNE_SKIPPED` or
  `EMIT_LITERAL_NORMALIZATION_SKIPPED` when their result would not parse; a
  canonical rendering that does not parse fails as a builder error naming the
  path, line and rendered snippet. Canonical handler methods now take the
  indentation the model's class uses (tabs, two spaces) and a one-line
  `class Handler: pass` gets its body on its own line; each used to produce an
  unparseable handler or put the appended methods inside the method above
  them. These edits now split source only at the line breaks Python counts: a
  form feed or `\u2028` in a docstring used to shift every edit by a line.
  Every `execution_failed` task now keeps its candidate as `rejected_output`
  when there is one, reports its error as `<ExceptionType>: <message>`, and
  logs `TASK_OUTPUT_PROCESSING_FAILED` or `TASK_EXECUTION_FAILED` at ERROR with
  the task, chat and traceback.
- An AppGenerator run that cannot continue now ends, once, and says why. In a
  live acceptance run bundle repair was blocked (no repairable target), and
  validation handed the turn to the user. Each reply re-ran the same validation
  on the same bundle, 13 times, until AG2 closed the channel on `max_turns`.
  The runner had already reported that last turn as a pause, because the hub
  delivers a packet before it appends the close it decided while accepting it.
  So no failed `chat.run_complete` was ever sent, the session stayed in
  progress, and the next message got "An internal error occurred"
  (`WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_FAILED`).
  - Blocked repair now ends the run as `workflow_failed`, as does a validation
    that ran again on an unchanged bundle and failed the same way
    (`app_validation_no_progress`; host temp paths are ignored when comparing).
    Only then does the gate write `app_build_failure_message`, which lists the
    blocking errors as single lines of at most 300 characters with host temp
    paths removed. A validation environment outage is reported as an
    environment problem the user can retry, not an app defect.
    `orchestrator.yaml` gains an optional `failure_message_key`, and the
    runtime reports that text as the failed run's `error` when the graph ends a
    run as `workflow_failed`.
  - The runner asks AG2's channel adapter whether the packet it is settling on
    closes the channel, and settles on the close instead of a pause. A failed
    `chat.run_complete` now carries the AG2 `close_reason`, and the session is
    marked failed before the event is sent.
  - A message for a paused run whose channel AG2 already closed is not
    delivered, and what the paused run already reported is not projected
    again. The run's end is announced once, also when the message arrives
    through background execution, and the caller gets
    `WORKFLOW_SESSION_TERMINAL` with the reason, as does a later message for a
    run that recently ended in this process.
- Studio's Integrations, Support, onboarding, security findings and messages
  no longer return 403 in a workspace that has a data contract (#790). Studio
  mounts its built-in modules into every workspace, but their persistence was
  checked against the workspace's contract, so the placeholder `mozaiks init`
  writes, and every generated app's contract, refused their collections. The
  built-in modules now declare their collections in
  `factory_app/app/data/contract.json`, and persistence composes those
  declarations with the workspace contract per dispatching module. The
  allow-list stays strict: app modules cannot reach a built-in module's
  collections, a built-in module reaches only what is declared for it, and an
  undeclared collection is refused for both. Onboarding status and security
  findings are owner-scoped per user. A workspace that overrides a built-in
  module by id owns its data, and one that redeclares a built-in collection
  fails to load. Owned upserts whose filter repeats the principal's owner
  field no longer fail with Mongo error 54. Session feedback, which those
  workspaces dropped silently while reporting success, is now stored.

- SecurityReadiness reports a signed-in module action without permissions by
  the records it can reach, not only by its module's own collections (#817).
  Runtime persistence does not bind a module to its own collections, so the
  rule reads sign-in (`app.json` `authRequired` with a valid
  `config/auth.yaml`), collection ownership in `data/contract.json`,
  entitlement gates in `config/subscriptions.yaml`, and every collection the
  module's code addresses through `ctx.persistence` and
  `app_data_from_context`, including code it imports from other modules or
  elsewhere in the app. Module code the scanner cannot read as addressing
  declared collections, such as reflection, run-time module changes, code
  loaded another way, or a database driver in any file the module's code
  follows, counts as reach it cannot resolve. An action without permissions
  is no longer reported when everything its module reaches is owned per user
  or per workspace. It is reported as high when the app declares no sign-in, when it
  reaches `app_wide` records without a gate the default plan withholds, or when
  it reaches records that no declared ownership scopes or uses persistence the
  scanner cannot resolve. It is reported as medium when an entitlement gate
  restricts shared records by plan only, or when its module reaches no
  collection and no gate the default plan withholds restricts it. The scanner
  reads only the app root the runtime binds, reports surface values the loader
  rejects, and returns findings instead of raising on a malformed data or
  module contract. Its reading of module code is bounded, so a loop that
  reassigns one name no longer makes a scan take minutes. A single function
  holding thousands of chained assignments still scans slowly, with a correct
  result. On a recorded generated app, six
  high findings for owner-scoped create, read, update, delete and a paid
  summary no longer appear. Dispatch tests on a real database check the
  verdicts for owner-scoped, per-workspace, shared, cross-module and no-sign-in
  variants.
  [Generated Action Protection](docs/architecture/app/generated-action-protection.md)
  holds the decision table.

- AppGenerator no longer rejects a module contract task because its output
  repeats a companion contract as a raw file. A live run's `task_management`
  contract set `module_contract.reactions_yaml` to null, as its module declares
  no reactions, and also wrote `contracts/reactions.yaml` with `reactions: []`
  into `code_files`, because its prompt listed every owned file. The task was
  rejected and deferred to repair. When the typed field is null and the raw
  companion declares nothing, the module declares none, so code now removes the
  duplicate and logs `MODULE_CONTRACT_RAW_COMPANION_DROPPED`. A raw companion
  that carries content (a real reaction or a runtime router) is still rejected
  with the fix, so no contract is lost silently. In `code_files` a populated
  typed field still replaces any raw copy, and a raw `module.yaml` without
  `module_contract.module_yaml` is still rejected. The ConfigMiddlewareAgent
  manifest guard now names the typed field that produces each owned file, and
  the output schema no longer tells the model that `code_files` mirror
  `module_contract`.

- DesignDocs no longer approves a sign-in page that an ordinary app surface
  places at the platform's own sign-in routes. A live run filed an `Authentication` page at `/login`, holding only an
  email/password form, under its `tasks` module; nothing in the design signs
  anyone in, so AppGenerator was asked to build `ui/pages/login.yaml`, a dead
  form at the route the platform serves sign-in on. The save now removes such a
  page from any app-owned surface, the way it already did on auth surfaces, but
  only at a route the platform owns: the generated auth contract's login,
  callback, and logout routes, or a route one nests under such as `/auth`. A
  page there is removed when no section has a typed binding to an app module
  and every section is a credential form (a password beside an email or
  username) or names nothing beyond identity claims. The removal is recorded as
  `removed_pages` on that surface, navigation to the page points at the login
  route, and the surface keeps everything else it owns. A page at one of those
  routes with app content stays approved. Known false negative: a sign-in page
  an ordinary app surface designs at any other route (`/signin`) also stays
  approved, because an email and password form there cannot be told apart from
  an app's own "connect your account" page (Jira, IMAP), which must never be
  removed.

- AppGenerator plan review merges one unit of work that the planner split
  across tasks claiming the same files. A live plan made one business_services
  task per action (create, update, delete, list), all owning the module's
  `service.py`; review rejected every attempt as overlapping ownership. Tasks of
  the same type for the same capability and surface that share a file are now
  merged into one, and references to the absorbed tasks follow it. Files other
  steps already assign (shared `app.json`, `config/subscriptions.yaml`, pack
  outputs, pages) never trigger a merge, and a plan that was accepted before is
  still accepted; tasks of different types sharing a file are still rejected.

- AppGenerator acceptance now runs the generated app, not only its files. A
  recorded app passed all ten static acceptance checks while it could not start
  with persistence enabled, crashed on every write and denied paying users. The
  new `app_runtime_smoke` check boots the bundle in a separate process with no
  host secrets in its environment and a hard time limit. It applies the
  bundle's indexes and migrations to a disposable database on the configured
  Mongo and calls its module actions as two signed-in users. Each user's records
  stay invisible and unwritable to the other, and each gated action is denied
  without its capability and allowed with an active plan assignment. Every
  failure names the action, user, expected and actual response and the file to
  repair, and goes through the existing bundle repair. Without a configured
  database the check reports `skipped` with the reason, and the build status
  pane shows it, never a pass. The database is dropped afterwards and startup
  services are not started. Mozaiks now requires python-dotenv 1.2 or later.

- AppGenerator plan review no longer rejects a page task for being named after
  its page. A live planner gave its four page tasks the surface ids
  `dashboard`, `pricing`, `billing` and `usage`; review rejected them as
  unapproved surfaces and the model resubmitted the same plan until the run
  ended. A page task with no capability that owns only approved page files
  (and `app.json`) is now labelled `page_bundle` by code; pages a selected pack
  provides are then released as before. Any other invented surface, including a
  page task that owns nothing, is still rejected.

- AppGenerator plan review now accepts only plans that task dispatch can run.
  A live run's plan owned `modules/billing_portal/contracts/*.yaml`; review
  accepted it, task dispatch refused the pattern, and the run ended with no
  chance to correct it. Review now checks every owned path with dispatch's own
  rules. A pattern is removed and logged: the module's contract task can
  already write any companion manifest. Any other path dispatch refuses
  (absolute, traversal, or a secret term) is sent back to the planner with
  dispatch's message. Before declaring a plan ready, review runs dispatch's
  owned-path and collision check on the exact tasks it will hand over, and
  lists every problem in one message. A selected pack's facade module, such as
  MozaiksPay's `modules/billing_portal/`, is now entirely the pack's: no task
  is planned for any file in it unless the pack asks for one.

- AppGenerator no longer plans a page section on an action that does not
  exist. A live run's plan bound its Dashboard KPI strip to
  `tasks/get_kpi_stats`, which no approved module declares; review accepted it
  and the page task failed both attempts. Plan review now removes a section
  hint's data source that is not in the approved action inventory, keeps the
  section, and tells the page task which actions its module does declare. Page
  compilation's unknown module/action error now lists the valid action ids (or
  the valid module ids) in the same message.

- DesignDocs no longer blocks a monetized app over two design details it can
  correct itself. A live run declared the users' plan as a `tier` field
  (`free`/`pro`) in a `subscriptions` collection, and listed `list_tasks` among
  its custom reads. Both were rejected, and the model's one retry could not fix
  both. Now `tier` is treated like `plan` and `plan_type`: while MozaiksPay is
  active, the collection is removed and billing_portal serves the plan. A
  newsletter's or alert's own `subscriptions` still stay app data. A custom read
  that duplicates a module collection's built-in list/get read is dropped and
  recorded. That run's output now saves, and the replayed corpus saves 88 of 90.

- A noninteractive workflow no longer fails while it is still making progress.
  Its deadline now measures inactivity instead of total run time: the run fails
  only after 300 seconds without an agent turn, context checkpoint, or message,
  and the error names the idle time and the last progress event. Previously a
  DesignDocs retry that was still streaming was cancelled 120 seconds after the
  run started. Workflows with interactive UI tools still wait for the user
  without a deadline.

- `config/subscriptions.yaml` is now fully code-owned. The factory constructs
  its `assignment_store` from the runtime defaults, keyed by the subscribing
  user, instead of letting the pricing designer author it. The designer's
  stores differed from the default only in `active_statuses` (`[active]` or
  `[active, trial]`), so generated apps now entitle the `pending` status hosted
  MozaiksPay sends for past-due, incomplete, and paused subscriptions, and the
  raw `trialing` status a Stripe-vocabulary writer sends. AppGenerator no longer
  schedules a model task for the file: assembly writes it from the approved
  contract, and `AppBuildPlan.monetization_provider` is validated against that
  contract. Removed usage-metering entries are explained in the review as plain
  sentences.

- Billing fulfillment clears a subscription assignment's stored expiry when a
  non-cancellation command carries none. A user who cancelled and was later
  assigned a plan without an expiry (hosted `assign_plan`) kept the
  cancellation's past `expires_at` and was denied as expired indefinitely.

- Generated apps can again create, edit and delete records from every table
  that lists a collection, whether or not a plan gates those actions. Since
  subscription pricing stopped gating features every plan includes, a
  task-tracker build shipped with no New or Delete button, and all ten
  validation gates still passed. Code now adds the missing New, Edit and
  Delete entry points for a listed collection's canonical writes, reusing a
  modal form the page already has for that action instead of adding a second
  one. The wiring gate now fails when any such write has no entry point and
  names the action and the page that lists the collection.

- SubscriptionContractDesigner now presents an approved subscription decision
  before plan design and surfaces requested corrections at the top of retries.
  A supplied plan design is saved as required even when the model labels it a
  no-op; a missing plan design still receives a correction request.

- Subscription-only pricing now saves when a generated metering declaration
  references a wallet the design did not declare: the declaration is dropped
  with an explanation in the review. Invalid metering targets for declared
  wallets receive the valid choices in one correction.

- DesignDocs saves the model's natural variation instead of rejecting
  corrections the contract determines. The live model changes a rejected design
  at most once and then resubmits it unchanged until the run is blocked, so each
  such rejection killed the run. Replayed through the real save path, 87 of the
  89 distinct recorded DesignDocs outputs now save (49 before). The other 2 are
  design decisions and get a message naming the three possible changes.
  - A local `subscriptions` collection holding only provider state (plan,
    plan type, status, period dates) is removed wherever it is filed. On a
    subscription surface, `subscribe_user` and `manage_subscription` become
    billing_portal's `start_subscription_checkout` and `open_billing_portal`,
    and page bindings follow them. Only pages billing_portal serves move to it;
    an app page such as `Alerts` stays with an app surface, or one rejection
    names every such page and each change that saves. While MozaiksPay is active, subscription status or
    type on a users collection is the account-profile projection it serves;
    without MozaiksPay those fields stay app data.
  - A managed timestamp's default (`"now"`) is dropped. So are an empty default
    on a non-string field and an optional non-string field's undecodable
    default. A default that means one value (`True`, `yes`/`no` on a boolean, a
    bare ISO date) is encoded instead of rejected.
  - An AI workflow surface the concept never asked for (no agentic
    capabilities) is saved as a `module` or
    `ui_only` surface.
  - A module lists the entities of the collections it owns.
  - A users collection that no surface declares is judged by its fields.
  - Sign-in actions and events are the platform's wherever identity is
    declared or stored. An `Account` holding a password hash, or a session store
    paired with login/logout, is recognized as platform identity.
  - Rejections name exactly what to change.

- Outputs a selected capability pack ships from its templates are no longer
  treated as model work. AppGenerator plan review stopped synthesizing a
  `billing_portal` module_contract/data_models/business_services trio for the
  MozaiksPay facade (whose module, schemas, handler and service the pack
  templates provide), and `page_bundle` no longer owns the pack's billing,
  pricing and usage pages; a worker's copy of any pack-owned path is discarded
  with a logged normalization, assembly takes those files only from the
  templates and checks the template pages themselves, and a template defect
  names its pack and source directory. A live greenfield build failed at
  assembly on exactly these paths. Page-schema errors now name the section,
  its primitive, the offending field and the allowed fields or values instead
  of "Field value does not match the registered page-schema contract", a page
  whose bindings were rejected still reports its schema errors in the same
  rejection, and a dotted metric key such as `items.total` whose final segment
  is a returned top-level field is constructed to that field.

- Code now builds what the generated module contracts determine, so the same
  live run's `task_management` module reaches acceptance without hand fixes.
  Canonical creates, updates and deletes own their events under one naming rule
  (`domain.<entity>.<created|updated|deleted>`): an approved spelling such as
  `task.created` is reconciled to it, its events.yaml entry is rendered with
  the stored record as payload, and the rendered service emits it after the
  write. Custom events keep their names; an emit and a declaration that differ
  only by the `domain.` prefix are reconciled, and anything else is rejected in
  one message naming both sides. Model-authored repository code that neither
  business logic nor any import-time statement reaches (the live run's dead
  `TaskRepo` class with Motor calls) is removed with a logged normalization,
  and a dynamic import of the module prunes nothing; a repository class or
  Motor call that business logic does use is rejected at task time with its
  site. A gated canonical
  create or delete on a listed collection gets a `New <Entity>` toolbar action
  with a modal form or a Delete row action with a confirmation dialog. A module
  owning `per_user` collections gets `user_data_scope: true` and a
  code-rendered account-data handler that exports and deletes the owner's rows
  through runtime-scoped persistence, which the account routes now inject into
  handlers that declare `persistence`.

- DesignDocs recognizes the platform's login/user system by what a surface
  declares, not what it is called. A surface such as `user_management` or
  `auth_module` normalizes to the platform when it declares a platform identity
  entity (`User`, `Session`, ...) whose collection holds only identity claims
  and carries a password or credential, or is unique on an email. Its identity
  collections, its user-lifecycle actions (`create_user`, `list_users`,
  `logout_user`, recorded as `removed_mutations`/`removed_reads`), its events,
  its sign-in pages and a page listing its user accounts are removed. Navigation
  to a removed user-administration page is removed, not redirected, until the
  admin portal serves user administration end to end. Identity fields typed
  `date`, or spelled in camelCase, no longer make the save fail. App entities
  that merely reference users (`TeamMember`, `Task.user_id`), an app's own
  `Session` entity, app fields stored beside a password, and actions such as
  `follow_user` stay app-owned. A surface mixing platform identity with app
  behavior is rejected, naming what stays app-owned on it.
- The DesignDocs prompt no longer uses a users module and a Users page as its
  worked examples, which taught the model to design the platform's user system.
  It uses a projects example instead, and says plainly that the platform
  provides sign-in, sessions, user accounts and user administration.

- DesignDocs saves a design whose authentication surface declares login/logout
  events or a sign-in page instead of rejecting it on every retry. The events
  and page are platform-provided, so they are removed and recorded
  (`removed_events`, `removed_pages`), typed navigation to the page points at
  the auth contract's login route, and the approved page inventory AppGenerator
  builds no longer contains a page the platform already serves. Only sign-in
  pages (auth contract routes or a credential form) are removed; any other page
  filed under an auth surface is rejected naming the app-owned surface it must
  move to, never dropped. Provider lifecycle events on managed billing facades
  are removed the same way. Genuine conflicts (a workflow consuming the event,
  a sign-in page co-owned by an app surface or bound to app data, app entities
  or actions on a platform surface) are still rejected, with feedback naming
  exactly what to split out.

- Generated persistence artifacts now name omitted indexes, stamp migration
  versions, exclude managed-facade collections, and declare subscription
  assignment aliases and collections. Apps can start with persistence enabled
  and resolve paid-user entitlements for managed and self-hosted billing.

- Canonical generated get actions return HTTP 404 for records absent from the
  caller's authorized scope, with a typed executor result that preserves server
  errors for unrelated lookup bugs.

- AppGenerator supplies page workers with action output schemas, compiles
  canonical list bindings, and rejects undeclared metric/table fields,
  nonexistent workflow buttons, and gated actions unreachable from pages.
  Where the accepted contracts determine the binding, code constructs it and
  logs the construction instead of rejecting the page: undeclared metric
  detail/trend keys clear, a metric id that names a returned field becomes its
  value key, a create/edit workflow button with no generated workflow becomes a
  modal form for the collection's one create/update action, and a gated update
  action on a listed collection gets an Edit row action and edit modal. A
  rejection now reports every page's errors at once, pages a selected pack's
  templates replace are not checked against placeholder contracts at task
  time, and an unreachable gated action is attributed to the authored page
  that reads its module rather than to the route manifest. The commerce pack's
  cart action declares its response fields and its products page can create a
  product; every pack's templates pass the wiring gate under test. The page
  Form primitive now submits `number`, `select` and `checkbox` fields with
  their declared types, and a single-token payload entry such as
  `{form.price_amount}` keeps that type, so a typed price reaches a module
  action as a JSON number instead of failing its input schema. A collection
  without `search_by` still gets its constructions: the record identity comes
  from a unique single-field index or the canonical update write's one
  required input, and every refused construction is logged with its reason.
  Only `owner: templates` pack outputs count as template-owned, the standalone
  save tool derives page paths from the route stem like the task worker, and an
  unreachable gated action with no authored page in the bundle is attributed to
  the plan's page task instead of being left unowned.

- Existing app data contracts load without newly introduced ownership fields;
  present fields remain validated, and factory generation requires complete
  ownership metadata. Generated module task instructions preserve custom reads,
  managed facade inventories use their complete pack contracts, and protected
  app-wide reads require an explicit access policy.
- AppGenerator preserves the previous bundle when assembly fails and reports the
  actual cause, routes bounded repairs to their owning task, and terminates
  unrecoverable failures without a retry loop. Plan normalization removes obsolete
  read and mutation endpoint hints, and undeclared-event repairs reach the module
  contract task with permission to write its events manifest.

- Generated pages select typed module/action data sources; code builds their
  endpoints and missing entity read contracts. Persistent module policies now
  come from declared collection scope, preventing invented routes and unfinished
  policy code while retaining wiring and runtime-quality checks.

- AppGenerator keeps runtime-only connector setup as deployment requirements
  while continuing to block on required build-time and validation-time setup.
  Integration declarations persist automatically after the readiness check.
  Auth scaffolding now runs idempotently before every app validation, including
  after user replies and repairs, without a separate agent turn.

- Generated subscription plans now require explicit capability-to-action choices
  from approved module inventories, and assembly deterministically applies those
  gates so paid plan differences cannot silently lose enforcement.

- DesignDocs excludes selected managed-pack facades from candidate owners for
  app-specific auth fields, so a billing facade no longer blocks a determined
  split to the app's sole domain module.

- DesignDocs recognizes standard OIDC claims and platform account/session fields
  in generated auth tables, and preserves app-specific fields under a uniquely
  determined app module instead of rejecting the entire table.

- DesignDocs normalizes determined platform auth/session and selected managed-pack
  ownership corrections before saving, preserving approved pages and app-owned
  data while removing only identified duplicate state. Saved designs record the
  changes and logs identify each normalization; ambiguous or mixed ownership still
  requires revision. AppGenerator continues to reject invalid approved ownership.

- AppGenerator resumes builds with task execution evidence through validation
  and bounded recovery, preserving accepted work and consumed repair budgets
  instead of restarting the planner after a user pause.

- AppGenerator derives required schema fields from property flags, eliminating
  conflicting required-name lists that blocked module-contract build tasks.
  Typed policy-hook schemas now use the same JSON Schema materialization.

- Paused and durable AG2 workflows resume with unchanged build-context contracts
  after JSON serialization of YAML keys and immutable context views. Changed or
  revoked protected content still blocks resume.

- AppGenerator constructs omitted page bundles and module task structure from
  approved inputs, including empty task plans, and shares required file and
  worker rules with validation. Unapproved scope and unresolved judgment still
  receive bounded feedback; read actions and unselected subscription providers
  are no longer guessed. Facade dependencies use registered provider bindings.

- AppGenerator rejects capabilities and tasks for unapproved surfaces before
  plan repairs or capability-ID checks, with feedback to remove invented work
  and keep authentication in the platform.

- AppGenerator repairs drifted module task capability labels when the approved
  surface and owned paths agree, preserving the planner's tasks and preventing
  coverage repair from assigning their files to duplicate tasks.

- AppGenerator repairs repeated task IDs across modules before plan validation,
  preserving each module's own contract dependencies. Monetized builds can plan
  both their app modules and the billing facade without duplicate-ID failures.

- AppGenerator repairs approved MozaiksPay facade capabilities before plan
  validation, keeping the managed provider separate from `billing_portal` and
  preserving approved data ownership through plan normalization.

- AppGenerator's UI review now commits its quality status through an authorized
  tool before routing, preserving the configured revision budget. Workflow pack
  repairs likewise merge through a tool before metadata and export, preserving
  workflows that already passed (#721, #727).

- Monetized greenfield subscription designs materialize missing Pricing,
  Billing, and Usage pages from the MozaiksPay pack before inventory approval,
  instead of rejecting the save when the model omits them. Existing page designs
  are preserved and assigned to the billing facade; subscription design and app
  planning keep the completed inventory unchanged.

- Registered hooks that could never fire now fire. An audit resolved every
  `middleware.yaml` entry and every `lifecycle_tools` entry with the runtime's
  own resolvers and called each one the way its runner does, on the production
  context container. The brownfield adoption hook, registered on six
  workflow/agent pairs, had a `(agent_name, context_variables)` signature while
  the runner calls every hook as `fn(agent, messages)`, and it returned text the
  runner ignores; it never ran (#723). The workflow-archetype hook keyed on a
  `capability_id` field that `WorkflowInPack` forbids, so it never injected; it
  now resolves the archetype from the declared workflow surface its task
  implements. Four `before_chat` tools read the frozen runtime container through
  wrappers that reject frozen values: the App Intelligence recovery card never
  emitted, the overview card ignored the catalog, the discovery collector
  dropped `discovery_inputs` and never emitted a progress card, and the theme
  collector ignored `parent_theme_config`. AppGenerator's
  `generated_workflow_trigger_events` read `trigger_events` from the workflow
  export, which stores `workflow_trigger_events`, so every run saw no trigger
  events and ConfigMiddlewareAgent was told no reactions were needed. A prompt
  hook that raises is now reported at WARNING rather than DEBUG, and lifecycle
  log lines now carry their chat and app ids. The detach guard now requires
  every context-reading helper to return plain data, and a new contract test
  pins each runner's call shape and checks every registration against it.

- Every prompt hook, shared helper and runtime reader that type-tested a live
  context read now reads plain data. Live containers freeze on read (a dict
  becomes a mapping proxy, a list a tuple) and none exposes `.data`, so a
  reader that tested `isinstance(x, dict)` or `isinstance(x, list)` on the raw
  read silently took the other branch. An audit that called each reader both
  ways found: the context-graph hook injected a `str(mappingproxy)` dump into
  every AgentGenerator, AppGenerator and ExistingAppDiscovery prompt; the
  managed-capabilities hook rendered every pack as a raw repr, dropped the
  facade and surface guidance, and leaked local pack paths; AppGenerator's
  before_chat hydration erased `generated_workflow_trigger_events`, so
  ConfigMiddlewareAgent was told no reactions were needed and the integration
  validator checked nothing; the module-contract quality gate audited zero
  files and passed every build; the AI-pack workflow, archetype and surface
  hooks and the workflow-archetype hook never injected; domain scoring ignored
  the concept; `collect_integration_needs` found nothing, so
  `config/integrations.yaml` came out empty and recorded needs were dropped;
  the admin-registry save dropped every earlier code file; the discovery
  tools ignored the preloaded source bundle and intelligence snapshot; the
  download tool skipped the pending schema migration and the validation and
  carry-forward records; the integration-test runner skipped in-context files;
  and the runtime's `context_get` dropped accumulated media assets. Each read
  now detaches, and the detach guard test also checks `list` tests, `... or {}`
  reads, direct `context_variables.get` reads, `_shared/` and the runtime
  helpers.

- A monetized app now gets `config/subscriptions.yaml` planned even when the
  subscription contract does not survive into AppGenerator's state. The contract
  designer's output is carried forward in two places — `subscription_contract`
  and, as a declared fallback, `subscription_contract_artifact` — and the build
  tools read both. The planning rules named only the first and treated a null
  value as "no contract", so a build with `contract_required: true` planned no
  `subscription_config` task, still declared a `monetization_provider`, and was
  rejected for naming a provider it had no task for. The rules now resolve the
  contract from either source and state that a provider and its task must be
  planned together.

- A monetized concept now gets its subscription contract. The contract designer
  was told that "monetized" is only a broad signal and was never told where the
  concept's own answer lives, so a concept whose `monetization_intent` recorded
  `subscription_contract_likely=true` still produced `contract_required=false`.
  The prompt now names `concept_blueprint.monetization_intent` and its
  precedence, and the save tool refuses a contradicting `contract_required=false`
  when monetization is enabled, returning the turn to the designer with the
  reason. Every save rejection now reports a declared review outcome, so a
  malformed contract's validation message reaches the designer instead of being
  discarded. Guard refusals and validation refusals draw on the same three review
  attempts as a user's own "Request Changes"; the guard is off when the
  operator's `MONETIZATION_ENABLED` switch is off and on brownfield paths, where
  the existing app may already own billing.

- DesignDocs now actually refuses a surface map that declares an AI workflow the
  approved concept never asked for. The check existed but never ran: it tested
  `isinstance(..., dict)` against a value that every live context container
  freezes into a read-only mapping on read, so it returned early on every real
  build while its tests passed on plain dictionaries. A refused save now returns
  to the agent with the reason in `design_docs_save_feedback`, over three
  attempts, instead of terminating the build three stages later at pattern
  selection with no path back to the user. DesignDocs saves now report a third
  outcome, `revise`, for a rejection the agent can fix; `blocked` remains
  terminal.
- A DesignDocs save rejection now reaches the agent with its reason intact.
  Rejections returned no declared outcome, so tool-outcome validation discarded
  the payload as unrecognised and replaced it with a generic failure, losing the
  message naming the offending surface.

- A module with no events, settings, or admin panels can now complete its
  contract task. Those companion manifests were required whenever a task owned
  their path, yet the same files were refused as raw output when their typed
  field was null, so a module with nothing to declare had no output that
  passed and its dependent pages and `app.json` were never built. Every typed
  companion manifest is now optional; only `module.yaml` is required. The
  rejection for a raw contract file now also says what to do when the field
  is null.
- Monetized app builds no longer stall at plan admission. AppPlanAgent is
  instructed to copy a task's `owned_paths` from its file contract, but the
  `subscription_config` contract was never included in the planner's injected
  context, so the planner produced a subscription task owning no files and the
  build was rejected before any work started.
- AppGenerator plan review no longer fails on its first attempt. The
  `app_task_batch_status` context variable listed only the task batch runner as
  an authorized writer, which locked out the declared workflow tools that set it
  and ended every build with a `context_authority.rejected` error before any
  plan was validated.
- App download and validation now use admitted current artifacts and repairs.
  Historical worker responses cannot restore rejected changes/deletions or
  overwrite a newer authorized repair, and migration registration preserves
  the accepted file bytes used by download and export.
- Factory generation now preserves task failures and successful outputs, supplies
  synthesized workers their actual prerequisites, and recovers eligible rejected
  tasks through the existing AG2 batch within finite budgets. Repairs respect
  approved task ownership; acceptance and export require the complete planned
  snapshot. Runs with missing diagnostics or uncertain interrupted attempts stay
  blocked instead of being reconstructed.
- Task ownership now accepts the canonical `security/secrets.yaml` policy
  artifact while retaining path safety checks and rejecting raw secret values.

### Changed

- Workflow agents can declare `pending_turn_replay: block` to stop automatic
  replay of uncertain AG2 pending turns. Existing agents default to `allow`;
  AppGenerator artifact workers now block replay. Deploy the runtime and Factory
  contracts together; migration and rollback are documented in
  [ADR 0011](docs/adr/0011-factory-bounded-task-recovery.md).
- Generated page actions are now five closed shapes chosen by `action_type`
  (`navigate`, `submit`, `delete`, `event`, `workflow`) instead of one shape
  with every field nullable. Each declares only the fields that behave on it,
  so `href` on a navigate action, `event_type` on an event action and
  `workflow_id` on a workflow action are required by the contract rather than
  checked after the fact, and a field belonging to another shape is refused.
- `ui.modal.open` / `ui.modal.close` actions name their target in a typed
  `modal_id` field. It is projected into the served `payload.modal_id` during
  materialization, so the runtime, the event bus and the Modal component are
  unchanged.
- A page rejection from `save_app_schema` now reports every defect it can see
  in one message, with the reason behind each, instead of stopping at the
  first. Page validation also runs the same deterministic modal repairs the
  task-batch lane already ran, including on baseline pages merged during a
  repair.

### Added

- `scripts/live_journey_driver.py` runs one build journey unattended, from the
  entry transition to AppReview promotion, as a plain client of a running
  host's HTTP and WebSocket APIs. It answers only the pauses and UI requests its
  prompt file scripts, never sends free text to validation or review agents,
  answers the AppWorkbench, and promotes the reviewed build before sending one
  promotion signal. It stops on every terminal event, at a wall-clock limit, or
  at a spend limit priced from the usage-pricing catalog, and exits 0 only when
  the host reports the journey complete. It writes `journey-websocket.jsonl`,
  `journey-http.jsonl`, `transitions.json` and `exit-reason.json`. It imports
  nothing from `mozaiksai` or `factory_app` and cannot retry, resume or cancel
  a run.
- `scripts/pinned_acceptance_env.py` installs one OSS commit or wheel into a
  fresh venv and proves that every package, the factory, workflow, chat-ui and
  web-shell roots, and every capability pack load from that venv, and that the
  runtime-check database answers. Only then does it start the host as a
  detached process on 127.0.0.1; `stop` ends it by PID. The host gets an
  explicit environment (operating-system variables, one named env file, and
  path variables pointing into the venv) and reads no `.env` file.

### Removed

- With authentication off, an anonymous user without roles no longer passes
  the admin check. Admin requires the `admin` role or the email allowlist.
  Workspaces scaffolded without `AUTH_ANON_ROLES` add
  `AUTH_ANON_ROLES=admin,user` to `.env` to keep the admin pages on their own
  machine; the refusal says so.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Factory build validation stages canonical workspaces and compiles their Python
  and shared shell rather than expecting app-owned npm projects. Validation agent
  schemas and prompts now include the runtime's Docker strategy.
- Shared UI fallback logos ship with the library instead of referring to assets
  in an individual app. Apps without a background image render a solid background.

- Explicit server-side app validation strategy now takes precedence over tool
  and workflow inputs. E2B preview polling no longer renews sandbox lifetime;
  failed/expired previews and graceful shutdown attempt provider cleanup.
  Configurable process/owner preview limits reject excess allocations with 429.
  One-shot validation fails when sandbox teardown cannot be confirmed and no
  longer returns a URL for a terminated sandbox.

- Persisted in-progress workflow sessions now resume through AG2 after a
  process restart instead of starting a second run when the in-memory input
  callback is gone.



### Fixed

- Bundle eval no longer fails an app for having no subscription plans when the
  app is deliberately free. Monetisation is now read from the bundle — an app
  whose module actions declare no `entitlement_gate` has nothing for a plan to
  resolve against — so a correctly generated free app is no longer scored as a
  defect. A bundle with no modules reports the check as undeterminable rather
  than passing or failing it.
- A build task the plan gate invents to cover a module's files now carries a
  prompt describing the work. Without one the task executor rejects it, so a
  repair meant to close a coverage gap instead ended the build — six such tasks
  stopped a live run with nothing generated.

### Fixed

- AppGenerator no longer abandons a build when the plan omits a capability for
  an approved module. The design already states that module's identity, source
  and entities, so the plan gate now fills the gap instead of rejecting the plan
  — a rejected plan produced no build tasks and therefore no app bundle at all.

### Changed

- The optional E2B integration requires the tested 2.x code-interpreter SDK
  (`>=2.10.0,<3`).

- Outcome-contract tools now log why they rejected a result, which attempt it
  was, and which budget ran out. A workflow that gave up previously recorded
  only that a tool "completed successfully" several times before failing — the
  reason existed in a context variable and never reached the log.

### Fixed

- Workflow transition aliases are released without closing the source chat's
  live WebSocket, so a reconnect cannot interrupt an in-progress build.








### Fixed

- AgentGenerator can advance past its interview again. Readiness was inferred by
  matching the literal token `NEXT` against the agent's message, which required
  the model to emit a bare token with no preamble; when it explained itself
  first, the match failed and the build waited on a user forever. The agent now
  states readiness in a validated structured-output field, written to routing
  state by a deterministic tool.

### Fixed

- A workflow transition no longer opens a second WebSocket for the same chat.
  Every close scheduled a reconnect, including closes the client itself caused,
  so moving between workflows raced a retry against the connection being built
  for the new chat and the server evicted the live one. The client now
  reconnects only from an unexpected close; a deliberate close, or an eviction
  by a newer connection, is left alone.

### Fixed

- WebSocket connection identity is now allocated from a monotonic counter
  instead of the socket object's memory address. Addresses are reused after
  garbage collection, so on a reconnect a departing socket's late cleanup could
  compare equal to the connection that replaced it and tear down the live one —
  defeating the guard meant to prevent exactly that.

### Fixed

- A reconnect no longer kills the build running behind it. When a second
  WebSocket arrived for a chat, evicting the stale one also dropped the pending
  input-request callbacks a running workflow uses to receive the user's reply,
  so the run could die mid-build. Eviction now releases the dead socket while
  leaving the execution armed; a genuine disconnect still clears them.

### Added

- Approval gates rendered by `ApprovalCard` now carry a stable
  `data-testid="approval-action-<id>"` derived from the action id, so tests and
  automation can drive them without matching model-authored button text.

### Changed

- Updated the AG2 runtime dependency to `1.0.5`.

- `web_shell` UI validation now fails when a surface declares its own copy of a
  shared design-system primitive (e.g. a local `Metric`). Import rules alone did
  not catch this: a hand-rolled component imports nothing and passed every check
  while rendering a drifted duplicate.

### Fixed

- Chat: the "..." typing bubble no longer sticks on screen after a run ends. It
  is added when an agent hands off and was only removed when a *next* agent
  spoke, so a run that finished or failed first left it there permanently.
- Chat: the "Jump to Present" button no longer lets message text read through
  it. It sat at 55% opacity over scrolled content, and shared a z-index with the
  scroll layer so it only painted on top by DOM order.
- `SubscriptionContractReview` now composes the shared `Metric` primitive
  instead of its own copy.

- Workflow UI: `ActionPlan` no longer crashes on render. It referenced two
  undefined names (`fonts`, `colors`), so the branch containing them threw a
  `ReferenceError` whenever it was reached.
- Workflow UI: the app-type chooser (`AppTypeSelector`) no longer shows a large
  empty box beside its choice cards. The monetization row now spans its own row
  instead of sharing a line with the first card and stretching to card height.
- Workflow UI: the workflow completion screen no longer shows a "Run Summary"
  heading with nothing beneath it when a run reports no duration or token count.
- Workflow UI: `AppIntelligenceOverviewCard` and `RepoAccessRecoveryCard` now
  use the shared design-system primitives instead of local copies, so their
  metrics, status pills, tabs, and buttons match the rest of the product.

### Added

- `web_shell`: `npm run render:workflow-ui` and `npm run shoot:workflow-ui`
  render every workflow UI component with a representative payload and
  screenshot it at desktop and mobile widths, for visual review.

### Fixed

- Generated Support pages now submit a ticket and its first message in one
  support action. Requesters can read and reply through ticket-authorized
  actions; generic messaging actions no longer expose support threads.

- The assistant widget starts a build at the app's declared entrypoint. With no
  workflow running, the workspace button routed to bare workflow mode, which
  resolves a workflow from stored client state — so a user with nothing running
  landed in whichever workflow that browser last touched (observed live as the
  brownfield adoption flow instead of the create-app selector). It now opens the
  entrypoint the app declares with `meta.freshStart`, discovered from shell
  config rather than hardcoded, so each app's own start-a-build surface is used.

- The widget's workflow button announces how many builds are running. The
  brand mark inside it supplied a static accessible name, so assistive tech
  read "Go to workflows" even with several sessions active while the tooltip
  said otherwise. One derived label now feeds both the tooltip and the
  accessible name, and the decorative mark is hidden from the a11y tree.

- The floating assistant widget always offers a way into a workflow. Its
  workspace button is no longer hidden when this browser has no stored
  session: the widget reads the user's in-progress sessions from the server,
  resumes directly when one is running, opens a picker when several are, and
  otherwise sends the user to the workflow surface to start one. The widget
  itself stays ask-only — this is the route back out of it.
- The collapsed assistant toggle is legible against the page: an opaque card
  surface with a solid primary edge and a full-size brand mark, instead of a
  faint translucent tab that was easy to miss entirely.
- Page routes share one themeable content measure (`--mz-content-max`, set by
  `theme.content_width`, default `wide`) instead of each route choosing its own
  max-width. The profile route no longer strands large empty gutters on wide
  viewports while workspace routes fill them.

### Added

- Pages can declare the ask-mode context they need. A page's
  `meta.ask_context` (in `ui/route_manifest.json`, or page-YAML `meta`) lists
  read-only module actions whose results are injected into the ask agent's
  prompt when the user asks from that page. Resolution is server-side and
  fail-closed: an action resolves only when its `module.yaml` opts in with
  `ask_context_safe: true` — a separate declaration from `api_surface`, so
  opting into ask context never widens an action's HTTP exposure. Dispatch
  runs in enforce mode with an empty permission grant and passes through the
  host `module_scope` resolver, exactly as HTTP and workflow dispatch do. The
  widget now sends the current route's `page_path` with each ask message, and
  the platform `ask_context` hook receives the page identity. AppGenerator can
  author both halves — `ask_context_safe` on module actions and page
  `meta.ask_context` declarations — and Studio dogfoods the contract on the
  workspace Support page (`workspace_support.list_support_requests`).

### Changed

- DataTable can opt into bounded server paging and search through declared
  module action inputs and required row/count response fields. ResourceTable
  keeps client paging; unsupported server bindings fail validation.
- Revision workers receive the original requested behavior within their owned
  tasks and operator contracts, including precise search, paging, default and
  mutation-outcome requirements.

- Ask-mode answers are grounded in server-side workspace truth. The general-mode
  exchange now reads the user's current workflow session from the session router
  (instead of the per-connection registry, which reported the ask carrier itself
  and never the real build session) and collects a host-provided workspace
  summary through the new platform `ask_context` hook — the Studio host
  contributes app-registry counts, the most recently updated apps, and the build
  currently in flight, which lives in a target-scoped session document the
  runtime's own snapshot cannot see. Finished sessions are no longer described
  as active workflows. The Studio `ask_mode_prompt` now describes exactly the
  context the runtime appends, and support copy points at the widget's 🛟 help
  button.

### Fixed

- Fix cold imports of auxiliary usage attribution and session binding contracts
  without requiring consumers to preload AG2 adapters.
- Factory account-data guidance uses the runtime's canonical collection naming,
  explicit app/user query scope, and JSON-safe exports for generated persistence.
- Generated form defaults and explicit table search fields survive the strict
  page contracts and materialization into the existing shared UI primitives.
- Summary metric columns adapt to their container width and wrap complete labels
  instead of truncating short labels in narrow dashboard panels.
- Factory planning receives exact materializer page paths and actionable
  case-sensitive filename feedback, avoiding repeated display-name/path mismatches.
- Factory form-action retries report known required-field errors and receive
  fixed-endpoint create/edit guidance without weakening runtime page contracts.
- Bundle acceptance validates the exact generated files and module actions,
  including frozen workflow context, instead of passing empty or stale wiring.
- Studio offers a fresh, owner-bound launch for failed workflows, with
  acknowledgement checks and disabled terminal-session input.
  Refinement retries recover the saved request and baseline without copying
  failed execution state, and reject routing drift before persisting a launch.
- Factory live previews boot saved, owner-bound app artifacts through the real
  platform host, shared frontend, and disposable Mongo database. Failed startup,
  expiry, and artifact changes clear stale preview URLs. A local Docker image
  supplies the canonical runtime without inheriting Factory credentials.
  Preview account export and deletion use the same private app database as
  generated module actions, so they can reach the user's saved records.
- Page-derived shell routes use the loader's exact file key, avoiding Linux
  404s when generated display names differ in case from page filenames.
- SecurityReadiness preserves its inspected artifact identity and review summary
  through declared chat transitions. Explicit internal-only actions with empty
  permissions no longer produce a false missing-permissions finding.
  Build validation evidence and registered staged paths survive the full review
  handoff; missing results stay missing, and zero findings are not mislabeled as
  a failed persistence operation.
- Workflow review components receive rejected response acknowledgements as errors,
  rather than showing an unaccepted or stale decision as submitted.
- UI review responses verify the saved session owner and app/chat scope before
  completing or buffering an interaction, over both HTTP and WebSocket.
- Live and restored artifact decisions use authenticated HTTP acknowledgement;
  download controls display rejected submissions and prevent duplicate in-flight
  decisions instead of treating a socket send as acceptance.
- Ask-context contracts now round-trip through generated schema-native page
  metadata. App loading and Factory acceptance reject unknown or ineligible
  ask actions against actual module contracts, including custom-route metadata;
  ask eligibility remains independent of HTTP exposure.

- Studio's policy footer now links to the privacy, terms, and cookie pages
  on mozaiks.ai so the website owns the policy content. CLI scaffolds and
  onboarding's minimal-shell refresh inherit these factory shell defaults.

- Auxiliary refinement agents now emit measured response usage through the
  existing runtime collector and configured token-wallet ingest. Trusted host
  app/user attribution is required; chat/build identity is attached only when
  actually allocated. Native AG2 schema-correction turns retain usage and retry
  middleware, and the auxiliary config adapter preserves provider controls.
  This does not account for every attempt or establish unknown provider cost.
- Profile and operator support tickets now group under the app they concern, show unavailable conversations instead of empty threads, send replies without a client-supplied sender role, and resolve hosted workspace scope during profile hydration.
- Factory workflow prompts use the semantic inputs exposed to each task instead
  of relying on named peers or unavailable output wrappers. Generated workflow
  guidance follows the same input and structured-response discipline.
- Preserve the original Factory build-event envelope across re-emission and
  lost acknowledgements. Successful delivery cannot be revoked by a late failed
  attempt, and already acknowledged events are not posted again by lifecycle hooks.
- The floating ask widget is now fully isolated from workflow sessions. Its
  WebSocket declares `transport_purpose=ask_carrier` at connect time, so the
  runtime never resolves the widget's carrier chat onto an in-progress build
  session, never auto-starts the entry-point workflow on it, and never replays
  workflow history into it — workflow agents (e.g. the build interview) can no
  longer appear inside the ask widget, and widget messages can no longer start
  phantom builds. Widget carrier chats created before this fix are retro-tagged
  on next connect so session listings stop offering them as resumable
  workflows, and the session router never substitutes an ask carrier as a
  resume target.
- The ask agent now receives the current screen's `page_context` with each
  widget message, so ask-mode answers are grounded in the page the user is on.
- The collapsed assistant toggle uses a higher-contrast branded surface, sits
  above the shell's mobile bottom bar instead of hiding behind it, and the
  widget header's support control is a lifebuoy instead of a bare `?`. The
  "Back to workspace" logo button also resolves the active workflow session
  from the server session snapshot when local storage was cleared.
- The Studio workspace mobile navigation trigger is a sticky top-of-content
  control (matching the admin layout) instead of a floating pill overlapping
  the shell bottom bar.
- Restore the Studio support desk in user profiles and authenticated operator dashboards; support requests now use a subject app reference without changing runtime scope and report storage failures instead of appearing saved or empty.
- Contextual workflow logging supports exception tracebacks so an error handler
  can persist failed indexing/build state instead of raising a logging error.
- Studio app/build summaries select owned generated targets through their build
  registry without changing the authenticated host scope. Build review filters
  app bundles instead of showing non-bundle App Intelligence projections as builds;
  demo data no longer replaces unavailable real apps.
- Mobile record cards wrap long values, and bottom navigation uses the app's
  light/dark theme. Dashboard run labels distinguish failed runs from completed.
- Structured-output compiler results retain their Pydantic model types. Artifact
  registration requires runtime context, and refinement lookups guard missing
  execution identity before reading app-scoped state.

- Preserve source line endings during app validation and export so Windows
  refinement does not repeatedly insert blank lines into unchanged files.
- Honor ResourceTable search fields and placeholder, preserve selected record identity
  after sorting, and guide generated primary tables toward full-width page layouts.
- Return HTTP 400 for explicit module service input-validation errors without
  masking unexpected application errors. Text-only branding no longer warns about
  an intentionally absent logo image.
- Preserve the requested chat when routing an in-page refinement and keep
  backend repairs scoped to validation rather than unrelated generation steps.
- Preserve canonical prompt-context views for detached task workers and retain
  captured themes when assembling partial UI theme output.
- Make AppWorkbench single-file refinement opt-in and use the canonical
  `brand/theme_config.json` artifact for theme refinement.
- Route module implementation validation failures through the existing bounded
  bundle repair graph without relaxing handler contracts or retry limits.
- Prevent Factory reconnects from replaying newly active downstream AG2 turns or
  overlapping context-packet callbacks, and await recovery settlement before user input.
- Include rejected task candidates in bounded validation retries so fresh AG2
  worker attempts can repair their output without bypassing ownership or quality checks.
- Display explicit user-facing messages from nonvisual automatic tools without
  exposing internal tool payloads or duplicating replayed messages.
- Preserve escaped Unicode and backslashes when replacing generated design
  document surface maps instead of interpreting YAML as regex replacement syntax.
- Keep workflow reviews visible on rejected or unconfirmed decisions and display
  submission errors instead of closing the review before server acknowledgement.
- Remove obsolete duplicate planner output examples and refer to the canonical
  structured response schema; task prompts reuse inherited build context.
- Attribute model usage to the validated run build binding without changing
  execution-host charging or trusting caller-supplied build IDs.
- Preserve registered operator-pack identity through typed app planning and
  template expansion; reject unregistered pack references before generation.
- Read workflow attachments from the execution session while keeping generated
  artifacts scoped to the bound target app.
- Route theme interviews using typed readiness and advance internal analysis
  directly to validated theme assembly, without chat-text routing markers.
- Security Readiness now saves findings through permissioned workflow module
  dispatch using the live session principal. Findings retain project/build
  association and cannot overwrite another project's matching scanner rule.
  Workflow handoffs tolerate brief reconnects while rechecking the original
  actor and fresh permissions before dispatch; started actions are never retried.
  Unavailable persistence and uninspected bundles remain explicit in review.
- Resolve Security Readiness input from the authenticated build binding and
  verified target-owned artifact, rejecting stale, foreign, or tampered bundles.
- Studio workspaces inherit packaged first-party modules through the standard
  app loader. App-local modules override defaults by id, so hosted workspaces
  can reuse Security Readiness without copying its implementation.
- Validate scoped repairs against the complete staged app, including canonical
  page schemas and action references, even without an indexed source workspace.
  Failed repairs no longer report that a patch was applied; successful patches
  are staged for review, not silently promoted.
- Reject invented module API surface values and incomplete explicit form
  payloads. Live metric/summary bindings share the canonical authenticated data API.
- Generate module event calls through `await ctx.emit(...)`, not a nonexistent
  context event bus, and reject that obsolete pattern during quality checks.
- Keep required text fields nonblank, details forms read-only, and modal controls
  accessible above mobile navigation, including on short viewports.
- Isolate Vite dependency caches per app so concurrent Factory and generated-app
  previews do not invalidate each other's prebundled dependencies.
- Keep authenticated generated page actions on the authenticated module API;
  reject nested page bindings to internal-only actions before export.
- Preserve unchanged pages during partial schema repair and validate the newly
  rendered files instead of a stale pre-repair bundle.
- Authenticate artifact downloads through Studio's canonical artifact endpoint,
  retain artifact identity for workflow exports, and only complete successful
  downloads. Restored download surfaces can respond without echoing large file
  payloads through the WebSocket.
- Carry table selection into edit/confirmation dialogs, authenticate page data
  and mutations, and preserve failed forms. Module deletions use the module
  action protocol; data-load failures are visible and retryable.
- Use canonical build-record identity when loading artifact context. Trusted
  refinement-router state is validated separately from untrusted launch inputs.
  Factory refinement profiles use the model exercised by local acceptance.
- Project explicitly planned event names into worker manifest guidance and use
  canonical companion paths under modules/{module_id}/contracts/.

- Save validated Factory implementation outputs through auto tools before quality
  routing, replacing extraction from a chat history that AG2 did not populate.
  Data-contract failures have an explicit bounded DatabaseAgent repair route.
- Reject invalid account-data implementations during module loading instead of
  silently skipping registration; load helpers in the module's actual Python
  namespace and send load diagnostics to the existing bounded Factory repair flow.
- Expose complete file constraints and the runtime persistence API to Factory
  workers. Reject unsupported Motor calls in generated repositories and changes
  to approved data fields or optionality before export.
- Detach protected export inputs so generated files reach the real download
  and artifact persistence path instead of producing an empty workbench.
- Let auto-invoked UI tools emit their own result surface; do not mount an empty
  component or announce download readiness from arguments before export runs.
- Preserve complete Factory prompts when catalog names appear inline in prose;
  prompt hooks replace only standalone section headings and share one updater.
  Planner category defaults cannot override approved scope exclusions.
- Prefer the basic table configuration for ambiguous basic-table structured
  output, avoiding resource-table-only fields rejected by the runtime.
- Preserve validated AppSchemaOutput pages through task execution and assembly;
  planner hints no longer overwrite forms, bindings, or interactions. Generate
  auth contracts before the complete-bundle validation that requires them.
  Validate page identity against its owned filename, keep display labels separate,
  and provide actionable URL diagnostics without exposing rejected input values.
  Forward build timestamps into task provenance materialization.
- Separate auth scaffolding from DownloadAgent-owned deployment packaging;
  do not emit partial deployment files or undeclared provision scripts before validation.
- Persist schema data through the canonical data_contract state and fail explicitly
  on rejected state writes. Valid dashboard page names are no longer rejected as
  placeholder copy. User-owned module planning includes the account-data handler.
- Keep initial prompts and interview replies visible to downstream workflow
  agents through AG2 channel broadcasts; settlement timeouts fail explicitly.
- Read protected task results, repair overlays, and app configuration as detached
  data during assembly instead of overlooking read-only context containers.
- Deliver declared workflow self-transitions through AG2's explicit audience
  support so bounded same-agent repair loops receive their next turn.
- Validate AppGenerator plan ownership and complete genesis file coverage before
  worker calls, with bounded corrective feedback. Capability origins use a finite
  vocabulary and registered managed packs; typed plan fields and frozen build
  context catalogs are preserved through plan caching.
- Clear stale AppGenerator plans before validation and terminate failed/empty
  plans instead of falling through to page generation without backend tasks.
- Make optional generated module manifests nullable and remove automatic admin
  panel generation outside the approved task's file ownership.
  Reject raw files that contradict an explicitly null typed manifest.
- Include generated-file and task-identity validation in the existing task retry
  budget, with corrective feedback on the next attempt. Exhausted failures stop
  assembly and retain authorized diagnostics through AG2 context events.
- Compile typed module action/capability and event schemas into runtime JSON
  Schema instead of emitting generator-only property lists. Request schemas
  obey the canonical closed profile; conflicting required fields fail early.

- Execute declared task batches at their actual trigger inside the AG2 graph,
  including interview-first builds, instead of checking only the first agent.
- Detach protected runtime state before AppGenerator schema persistence and UI
  quality checks so valid upstream data contracts are not rejected as non-objects.

- Refresh each agent's declared context in the existing AG2 prompt middleware
  before every model call, so later steps and revision attempts see current
  tool results and user feedback instead of launch-time values.
- Workflow tool loading registers Python module globals before execution so
  typed models, dataclasses, and postponed annotations work in generated tools.
  Reloads still refresh workflow-owned code; failed imports leave no partial module.
- AgentGenerator supports approved apps with no AI workflows, records an explicit
  empty workflow bundle, and clears stale workflow hints. Draft-correlated review
  actions replace approval keywords; invalid plans receive bounded correction
  attempts and cannot contradict the canonical design surface map.
- Preserve workflow UI registrations across reloads and carry only declared,
  writable launch inputs between journey steps. Handoff errors are visible in
  chat; completing one workflow no longer claims the whole build is complete.
- Factory theme, design, and subscription saves consume read-only structured
  output through detached values and use declared failure outcomes. Failed
  persistence or unavailable subscription review cannot advance the build.
- DesignDocs index keys now use typed `field`/`order` entries, matching
  AppGenerator. Untyped arrays and values are rejected before strict model calls.
- Treat unmatched workflow transitions and exhausted AG2 turn limits as failures,
  including when channel closure races a user handoff. ThemeCapture declares
  user-return edges; AgentGenerator uses the authorized exact `NEXT` trigger.
- Prevent stale browser storage from undoing live workflow handoffs and old
  WebSocket close handlers from removing replacement connections. Failed message
  submission is visible instead of leaving an indefinite typing indicator.

- Bind app service imports to the selected workspace on reload and reset
  platform health state for each startup attempt.
- Keep Factory execution identity separate from generated-app targets through
  handoffs, revision routing, artifact access, and downloads. Generated bundles
  are promoted into version-specific workspaces, not the running Studio app.
  Build identity and lifecycle pointers are server-owned; callers select an
  owned registry record instead of supplying target IDs or artifact paths.

- Build-record and version-counter uniqueness now follows `build_family` and
  `build_key`. Known retired indexes are replaced without deleting records;
  failed index initialization is retried instead of leaving a half-ready store.

- Preserve explicitly empty generated files, including Python package markers,
  so app service imports resolve from the generated bundle.

- ValueEngine concept review now waits for a structured approve, request-changes,
  or cancel action tied to the displayed draft. Stale reviews, failed saves, and
  invalid responses cannot complete the workflow. The declared review budget is
  three proposals per run, with retries only after an explicit request for changes;
  this is an execution guard, not a subscription allowance.

- Preserve explicit provider-native output token limits and SDK retry counts
  when converting runtime LLM configuration to AG2. Invalid, conflicting, or
  unsupported limits now fail before a provider request instead of disappearing.
  This does not introduce a wallet reservation or a total-spend guarantee.

### App workspace alignment

- Add an advisory `SecurityReadiness` Factory workflow and build context so generated app bundles can surface baseline auth, secret, permission, tenant-scope, deployment, and eval-readiness findings during AppReview.

- Add a first-party Factory `security_readiness` module for app/build security
  findings, summaries, and review status without introducing hosted-only
  compliance logic into OSS.
- Expose the existing reference bundle evaluator through `factory_app.eval` so
  hosted apps can consume it without copying the implementation. Factory build
  events carry bounded generation evidence through the existing authenticated
  outbox; removed proprietary Build Intelligence HTTP hooks from OSS workflows.
- Resolve packaged Factory prompt catalogs outside source checkouts and combine
  explicitly declared workspace projections. Configured launch-provider failures
  propagate instead of silently discarding enrichment.
- Resolve workflow UI using the backend's explicit default-registry inheritance
  and workspace folder overrides. Added installed-workspace composition proof to
  wheel CI.
- Add `validate_app_workspace` for shared declarations and static action/route
  closure with explicit inherited UI; generated bundles retain stricter output
  and placeholder checks.

### Security

- Reject startup hooks that change immutable runtime identity or authorization
  context before agent creation and model dispatch, including hooks that swallow
  their own errors. This is a runtime invariant, not a generated-app target resolver.

- Factory now declares its authentication and runtime secret contracts. The
  shared shell uses backend-confirmed auth mode and shared OIDC sign-in;
  failed configuration cannot silently create a demo identity. Generated auth
  adapters delegate to the shared implementation. Runtime model and MongoDB
  secret lookups consume the selected names-only policy.

- Studio App Registry reads, updates, promotions, and deletes now carry the
  caller's owner scope into Mongo filters. Reopening an app ID cannot transfer
  ownership; concurrent same-owner creation is idempotent. Directory deletion
  no longer erases app-wide usage facts. Module creation without a target ID
  allocates a new app instead of reusing the Studio host's identity.

- App secret declarations now use one typed names-only contract in generation,
  validation, and runtime. Invalid or explicitly missing policies fail closed;
  selecting an app never borrows another workspace's manifest. Environment-only
  apps need no vault service. Generated secret entries now use the runtime's
  canonical `env` object shape.
- Account export and deletion now bind the authenticated principal and the
  canonical app-data database before invoking module lifecycle handlers.
  Signed-token Mongo tests cover ownership, app isolation, and repeated deletion.
- **Production-safe browser WebSocket authentication**: the shared browser client
  no longer puts the access token in the WebSocket URL
  (`?access_token=<jwt>`), where it leaked into server access logs, browser
  history, `Referer` headers, and shared links. The credential now travels in
  the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` handshake header — the one request header the
  browser WebSocket API lets a client set — as
  `["mozaiks.bearer.v1", base64url(token)]`. The runtime decodes it, validates
  it through the same configured auth adapter as HTTP routes, binds the same
  `WebSocketUser`, and echoes back only the marker, never the credential.
  Authenticated browser connections therefore work in production and staging
  **without** setting `MOZAIKS_WS_ALLOW_QUERY_TOKEN=true`. Query-string tokens
  remain rejected by default and stay available only as an explicit
  local-development opt-in for non-browser clients. Auth-disabled local
  development is unchanged. The credential component must be canonical unpadded
  base64url: illegal characters, whitespace, padding, trailing garbage,
  impossible lengths, invalid UTF-8, and non-canonical encodings are refused
  before the auth adapter runs, with their own bounded close reason, and are
  never sanitized into a usable credential.
- **Fail-closed module action dispatch**: `ModuleExecutor` no longer falls
  back from an undeclared action id to a same-named Python handler method.
  Only action ids declared in the module's contract
  (`module.yaml` `actions[].handler_method`, mirrored in the registered
  `action_method_map`) are dispatchable; unknown or undeclared actions —
  including event-reaction handlers, private helpers, and arbitrary handler
  attributes — return `ACTION_NOT_FOUND` before any handler resolution, for
  trusted and enforce-mode authorities alike. The rejection path never
  touches the handler object (no `getattr`/`hasattr`, so hostile
  properties/descriptors/`__getattr__` cannot execute), and denied audits
  carry only a bounded, sanitized action string.
- **Fail-closed authentication configuration**: auth-mode environment
  variables are interpreted by one canonical resolver
  (`resolve_auth_config`) consumed by every predicate, adapter resolution,
  and startup validation. With `AUTH_ENABLED=true`, a missing, misspelled,
  or incomplete auth provider configuration is fatal at startup (runtime and
  platform/Studio hosts) and at provider resolution, in every environment.
  Contradictory explicit declarations (`AUTH_ENABLED=true` +
  `AUTH_PROVIDER=none`; `AUTH_ENABLED=false` + a real explicit
  `AUTH_PROVIDER`) and unrecognized `AUTH_ENABLED` values are fatal instead
  of silently resolving. **Unauthenticated operation is now allowlisted:** it
  is permitted only in the recognized local environments `development`,
  `local`, `test` (`dev` normalizes to `development`) or with no environment
  configured. Every other explicit `ENV`/`ENVIRONMENT` value — `production`,
  `staging`, and unknown or regional names such as `prod-us`,
  `production-east`, `preview`, or `qa` — refuses no-auth operation
  (explicit disable or implicit demo) independent of
  `MOZAIKS_STARTUP_CHECKS` mode, while still booting normally with
  authentication configured. `ENV` and `ENVIRONMENT` are resolved
  canonically: blank values are absence (a blank `ENV` cannot mask a
  deployed `ENVIRONMENT`), aliases normalize before comparison, and two
  non-blank values that disagree are a fatal configuration error rather than
  a silent pick. The cached auth adapter is keyed by the complete
  provider-specific configuration snapshot it is built from — issuer, JWKS
  and discovery URLs, audience, every claim mapping, scope format, clock
  skew, algorithms, cache TTLs, Keycloak claim mappings, Supabase secret,
  and anonymous-persona settings — so changing any of them rebuilds the
  adapter and no stale adapter can serve requests under newer configuration.
  Custom adapters declare a `config_identity` at registration to participate
  in that cache identity, and are never cached without one; malformed
  identities (non-string, empty, whitespace-only, or a raising callable) are
  rejected rather than coerced into a cache key. The adapter constructor
  contract is established *positively* at registration by binding the
  runtime's exact invocation against the complete signature: `settings` as a
  keyword (or `**kwargs`) receives the snapshot, a constructor whose other
  parameters are all optional is built with no arguments, and anything the
  runtime cannot actually invoke — `(settings, required)`,
  `(required, **kwargs)`, a positional-only `settings`, any required parameter
  it cannot supply, or a signature it cannot inspect — is rejected instead of
  being assumed to take no configuration
  (`register_adapter(..., constructor_mode=...)` declares the contract
  explicitly for uninspectable constructors). An exception raised inside a
  constructor body — including `TypeError` — fails closed instead of
  triggering a retry that would discard the canonical configuration. An adapter's lazily created OIDC discovery and
  JWKS clients now inherit its snapshot (URLs and cache TTLs) and never
  consult live environment or global `AuthConfig`, so an adapter built under
  one configuration cannot begin validating tokens against another; explicit
  constructor input to those clients is authoritative. `AUTH_JWKS_CACHE_TTL`
  (default 3600) and `AUTH_DISCOVERY_CACHE_TTL` (default 86400) are validated
  (integer seconds, zero or greater; `0` means always refetch and is never
  treated as unset) during configuration resolution, so malformed values fail
  startup instead of surfacing during lazy client creation on a request path.
  Absent, empty, and whitespace-only values normalize identically through one
  canonical resolver shared by configuration resolution, the adapter config,
  and `AuthConfig`, and cache expiry compares elapsed time against the TTL so
  every accepted value — including very large ones — stays usable at request
  time.
  Implicit demo mode (no auth configuration at all, in an environment that
  permits it) still boots for local getting-started use.
- **Fail-closed billing fulfillment ingress**:
  `POST /api/billing/fulfillment/apply` (and the fulfillment admin listing)
  now requires the internal API key, an *authenticated* billing-admin
  principal (`UserPrincipal.is_authenticated` — real bearer-token
  provenance, not role/scope strings, which anonymous and dev-persona
  principals can carry), or explicitly disabled authentication
  (`AUTH_ENABLED=false` / `AUTH_PROVIDER=none`, which protected
  environments reject outright). Auth being merely unconfigured no longer
  makes the ingress callable without authentication.

### Added

- **Billing fulfillment revision fencing**: `BillingFulfillmentCommand` accepts
  an optional `subject_revision` — a provider-neutral, monotonically increasing
  ordinal that the upstream billing source allocates per entitlement subject
  when it commits a canonical revision. Subscription effects now commit only
  when the incoming revision is strictly newer than the one already stored for
  that subject, compared atomically on the assignment document at write time.
  An out-of-order command (an older HTTP request that completes after a newer
  one has already been applied) is suppressed rather than regressing
  entitlement state: its assignment and plan-allowance effects are `skipped`
  with reason `stale_revision`, and the result carries the new terminal status
  `superseded` so the sender can settle it without retrying. The last committed
  revision is stored in the assignment document under the new
  `assignment_store.revision_field` (`billing_revision`, or null to opt out —
  the field is a fixed authority name, not a customization point). Plan token
  allowances are fenced at their own commit too: the ledger accepts an opaque
  `subject_key`/`subject_revision` pair and folds the ordering predicate into
  the same single-document update that changes the balance, so a stale command
  cannot mint tokens even if it was already mid-flight when a newer revision
  committed, and the wallet-side ordering head advances for every accepted
  revision — including cancellations, zero-allowance plans, and revisions that
  reuse an existing period allocation — so "latest accepted revision" is what
  fences a delayed older allowance, not "revision that last minted tokens".
  That ordering authority is claimed on every applicable wallet *before* the
  assignment commits: a revision only becomes the newly authoritative one once
  no wallet its subject can reach still admits an older revision, and a wallet
  that reports a newer revision means the command was overtaken, so nothing
  applies. A head write that *fails* is not a decline: it propagates, nothing
  applies, and — because that failure provably precedes every effect — the
  durable command reservation is released so the identical command can be
  retried instead of being refused as permanently pending. Wallet heads already
  claimed are never reversed; the retry finds them equal and proceeds.
  A wallet balance only ever moves under a reservation the invocation has
  positively acquired: a pending reservation is taken by compare-and-swap on
  exactly the reservation fields the stored document actually carries —
  including their absence, so an entry written before reservations were
  tracked is still adoptable and a movement that already committed stays
  recoverable — and a lost swap means re-reading and reacquiring rather than
  writing anyway. A newer, entitled revision may adopt
  a reservation a stale attempt left behind, and rollback then only ever
  deletes a reservation the rolling-back attempt still owns.
  Fencing is one decision for the whole command: an app that sets
  `revision_field: null` gets prior behavior from both the assignment and the
  wallet. Enabling fencing requires one assignment row per entitlement subject,
  enforced by a unique index over the configured subject paths — a store that
  already carries an equivalent unique index provides that guarantee under
  whatever name it uses and is accepted as is; pre-existing duplicate subjects
  fail closed with an actionable error rather than being silently resolved. `billing_revision` is reserved — no other assignment
  mapping may target it — and a command whose remaining effects are invalidated
  by a newer revision reports `superseded` even when an earlier effect applied.
  A replayed command reports `original_status`, preserving whether it
  originally applied, was rejected, or was superseded. Commands that
  omit `subject_revision` are applied unfenced exactly as before and keep their
  pre-existing durable command identity, so upgrading cannot turn a previously
  completed command into a content conflict.

### Fixed

- Declarative workflow agents no longer receive undeclared AG2 network
  delegation/discovery tools automatically. Declared tools and AG2 graph
  execution remain available. Continuation timeouts now return failed results
  and close live-run clients instead of escaping as an exception or pretending
  to await human input.
- Workflow entrypoints, transition choices, and refinement launches now forward
  the configured auth adapter's access token through the shared API helper.
  Authenticated builds no longer fail at these steps with a missing-token error.
- The shared app shell now binds chat and workflow defaults to the active
  host's app identity, waits for shell configuration, and no longer launches
  under an implicit `demo-app` scope.
- Live workflow smoke checks now read canonical AG2 run events and wait for
  resumed user turns. Reconnect replay emits versioned event envelopes, and
  runtime-seeded chat/user identity remains available to usage accounting even
  when workflows declare no application context variables.
- Workflow composer continuations no longer block the WebSocket receiver while
  awaiting UI tool responses. Task-batch continuations receive current declared
  worker results; the UI smoke dogfoods single-attempt approval and artifact
  outcomes instead of model-controlled tool repetition.
- Generated workflow exports now validate all runtime YAML contracts and tool
  implementations before packaging or repair. Capability-pack templates reject
  missing inputs and invalid rendered YAML/JSON; readiness configuration preserves
  string values containing YAML punctuation.
- Workflow operations can declare validated outcomes and enforced attempt budgets.
  AgentGenerator materializes their context and transition rules from typed plans;
  factory export failures now route to bounded repair or user attention instead of
  completing as successful downloads.

- **Exact structured-output auto-tool contracts**: declared workflow
  structured outputs are now exact at runtime — an agent output carrying an
  undeclared field (top-level or nested) rejects before any normalization, so
  no `agent_output_validated` event, auto tool, UI emission, or persistence
  can run on silently stripped data. Deliberately declared open
  `dict`/`optional_dict` fields keep accepting arbitrary keys inside. The
  documented auto-tool contract
  `context_variables.get("structured_output")` is now truthfully served as a
  transient, runtime-owned, read-only projection of the exact validated
  output: context-only auto tools work without declaring context variables,
  explicit-param auto tools receive the same values, and the projection can
  never be written, persisted, or replayed as workflow state.
  `structured_output` is reserved runtime vocabulary: declaring it in
  `context_variables.yaml` now fails workflow validation with no metadata
  override, and overlay enumeration/snapshots never expose a colliding stale
  base key. Auto-tool binding caches hold declarative metadata only,
  self-validated against the live structured-output registry and tool
  declarations (reload, unload, refresh_all, and failed reloads can never
  execute a stale binding); the executable tool callable is resolved fresh
  through the canonical loader on every dispatch, so workflow-owned tool and
  imported helper changes (in both the `workflows.*` and derived real package
  namespaces such as `factory_app.workflows.*`) are observed without restart,
  while external installed packages remain a documented process-restart
  boundary. Each binding receives its own detached copy of the validated
  payload (explicit-argument mutation cannot contaminate another binding or
  the audit record), turns are claimed in-flight atomically, and every
  binding keeps a finite process-local execution checkpoint: once a tool
  returns a truthful terminal result (success or failure) it is never
  re-invoked for that turn — retries after cancellation resume unfinished
  post-processing stages (write-back, persistence, result emission) instead
  of re-running the tool. This is process-local runtime idempotency, not
  distributed exactly-once delivery.

### Changed

- **YAML-first workflow and integration config contracts**: generated workflow
  declaratives and app integration sub-configs now consistently use `.yaml`;
  retired JSON prompt artifacts and stale JSON-path guidance were removed.

- **Canonical capability-pack action requests are closed**: all 63 actions
  across the 10 workspace_handler_split pack modules (commerce, entitlement
  dispatch, files, messaging, MozaiksPay billing portal, notification settings,
  activity feed, friends, user posts, support) now declare
  `additionalProperties: false` at every object level and import under the
  closed-contract profile. Unknown extra request keys are rejected at dispatch.
  Open metadata maps became typed `{key, value}` entry lists (entitlement
  dispatch, files, messaging) or closed objects with declared keys (activity
  feed, commerce `raw_event`); handlers store the same record shapes as before.
  Schema `default`/`maxLength`/`nullable` keywords moved to handler and service
  code with identical behavior; post/comment body length limits are now
  service-enforced. Generated modules and workspace action extensions must keep
  request schemas closed by default.

### Added

- **Content-resolved implementation artifact authority**: implementation
  selection for the future ImplementationBinding v2 now proves exact scope,
  canonical artifact family/address, exact verified bytes, and exact document
  schema versions for `orchestrator.yaml`, `structured_outputs.yaml`, and
  `module.yaml` — resolved only through the immutable blob store, never a
  filesystem path. Structured-output contract refs resolve only against the
  selected workflow's exact configuration. Handler, base-handler, and
  pack-contract sources are scope-bound selections (execution scope must
  equal the requesting scope and the module selection's scope), and module
  handler sources carry a bounded static export proof with exactly two
  certification modes and no general source closure: `EXPLICIT_HANDLER` (a
  true standalone class — zero bases — explicitly defining the action
  `handler_method`) and `CANONICAL_BASE_HANDLER` (the two-source
  workspace_handler_split closure, whose ownership authority is
  content-resolved from the exact verified bytes of the module's owning
  capability-pack `contract.yaml`, never caller-asserted; the canonical base
  import must be an unconditional top-level statement before the class, and
  a leaf override of the selected method stays a two-source certification
  with a recorded `method_source`). Certified implementation identity covers
  the leaf digest, base digest, and pack-contract digest; rebinding
  analysis is closed over the full Python binding grammar including
  exception-handler and match-pattern captures. The entire real canonical
  split-pack corpus — 10 modules, 63 actions — certifies end to end with
  proven pack-contract blob reads. The split-capable certifier is internal:
  `resolve_module_action_implementation` is the only public
  authority-producing API (no exported function accepts a preconstructed
  split authority), direct dynamic-execution primitives are rejected in
  construction scope even through `builtins` access, aliased builtins
  imports, or simple rebinding, uninspected locally-defined callables cannot
  be invoked or applied as decorators during module/class construction, and
  construction-time anonymous lambdas are prohibited except a lambda stored
  directly in a simple named binding (deferred runtime helpers remain
  allowed; a bounded own-source proof — not a proof of arbitrary imported
  dependency behavior), and pack-contract
  `required_outputs` must be unambiguous: duplicate paths and omitted or
  non-canonical authority-relevant owners reject. The commerce module
  manifest's capability entries were repaired to the canonical
  `ModuleCapability` contract (unique capability ids with `kind`/`title`),
  which module loading requires.

- **Closed semantic action requests**: `ActionPayload.request_contract` replaces
  shallow request fields with one immutable, bounded contract algebra for null,
  scalars, homogeneous arrays, and closed objects. Offline module-schema imports
  reject unproven closure and unsupported assertions. Executable module dispatch
  schemas retain their current authority; realization proofs remain deferred.
- **Canonical workflow module interfaces**: the offline compiler renders
  `mozaiks.module_interface.v2` from exact workflow capability, result,
  binding, module, and event-taxonomy sources. Advisory results are retained;
  event identity changes invalidate reuse through the real rematerialization
  path. Both canonical layout representations enforce row-first output
  identity. The retired factory writer stays absent. App workflow registry,
  runtime routing, and persistent workflow launch remain separate/deferred.
- **Node-level taxonomy identity in plan and reuse authority (ADR 0007)**:
  `CompilationPlan` units gain a generic `taxonomy_sources` contract
  (`PlanTaxonomySource`: exact `(node, category, identifier)` triples under
  the closed taxonomy vocabulary and grammars) for canonical identities that
  live on graph nodes rather than typed payloads. Identifiers are stored in
  canonical spelling at model construction, including trimmed whitespace.
  A pinned taxonomy identity
  now participates in unit identity, serialization, canonical authority
  rederivation, and — closing the defect found in the #479 review — the
  regeneration/reuse signature: a unit whose node-level identity changed can
  never be classified reusable, so stale bytes are never copied forward.
  Empty taxonomy sources are omitted from identity and serialization alike,
  keeping every pre-existing plan unit byte- and digest-identical. The
  workflow module interface is the first family deriving these sources.
- **Typed module↔workflow capability semantics**: the semantic graph now
  models the relationship between deterministic application capabilities
  (modules, actions, events) and agentic capabilities (workflows) as
  canonical typed identity instead of stringly convention. Three new node
  kinds — `workflow_capability` (the application-semantic identity of one
  workflow capability: a stable `capability_id` owned by exactly one
  workflow), `workflow_capability_binding` (one directional, typed
  relationship per node: `consumes_action`, `commits_result_through_action`,
  or `triggered_by_event`), and `workflow_result` (the typed,
  capability-owned semantic identity of one workflow output — never a
  provider schema, model class, or AG2 runtime id) — plus `ModuleActionRef`,
  the exact module/action node identity that carries no HTTP path, handler
  path, or AG2 tool identity. Typed payloads own application meaning; graph
  edges are derived projections: every action used through `ModuleActionRef`
  must have exactly one canonical module owner, event-production authority
  comes from typed `ActionPayload.emits` joined to the EVENT node's canonical
  taxonomy identity (a bare EMITS edge can never invent production), commit
  bindings reference a declared `workflow_result` node owned by their own
  capability (result fan-out is explicit: several commit bindings referencing
  the same result node), and each capability/binding/result node must
  participate in exactly its derived edge set — full edge identity,
  discriminator included — so payload-unbacked edge mutations fail closed.
  Every module-declared action forms the canonical ownership family: its
  complete declarer set must close to exactly one module (contradictory
  non-module DECLARES edges are never filtered away), every typed emit must
  resolve to exactly one EVENT node carrying exactly one canonical identity
  — independent of whether any workflow or trigger consumes the event — and
  its EMITS edge set must equal the typed projection exactly.
  AG2 Agent/Task/Network identities stay out of the graph — a Mozaiks
  workflow capability is application semantics; AG2 runtime objects remain
  execution implementation details. The offline projection now records
  module-manifest action `emits` into the typed `ActionPayload` it already
  drew EMITS edges from. The new semantics are offline contracts: no
  module_interface.yaml rendering, no layout-registry families, and no
  production AppGenerator/AgentGenerator wiring in this change.


### Fixed

- **AG2 Network tool routing**: declared tools retain authorized context writes
  and hand off from actual tool-call events, including turns with no text.
  Source-agent scoping and context-write policy remain enforced through graph
  reload and packet publication.
- **Provider-neutral structured-output identity**: canonical contracts now pin
  a versioned acceptance profile and truthful optionality independently of
  provider wire formatting. Build and cold resolution consume the same explicit
  model authority. Module schema checking and evaluation failures now reject
  validation instead of reporting success; explicit empty schemas remain valid.
- **Canonical plan authority is now enforced across execution and durable
  revision closure (ADR 0007 lane)**: assignment compilation
  (`compile_approved_plan`), composition (`compose_plan_artifacts`, including
  the base plan in refinement), revision persistence, cold
  resolution/restoration, promotion, and CURRENT resolution all require the
  exact immutable `CompilationPlanAuthorityInputs` and canonically rederive
  the plan before any authority is exercised — self-digests, refs, and
  ledger digest chains prove integrity and identity only, never truthful
  derivation. `ArtifactRevision` now pins a content-addressed
  `compilation_plan_authority_ref` as part of immutable revision identity,
  and the authority document is persisted content-addressed
  (`CompilationPlanAuthorityInputsV1`) so every fresh process repeats the
  rederivation. Plans carrying brownfield content (`preserve_unowned` /
  `reuse_from_base`) fail closed with the typed `base_authority_missing`
  category until the immutable base-input authority contract exists; the
  former synthetic 5B/5C fixtures that composed fabricated preserved bytes
  are replaced by canonically derived fixtures. Plans also no longer emit
  the former unconditional "registry" renderer-resolution pseudo-gap, which
  made the composition zero-gap contract unsatisfiable by construction.
  Canonical authority additionally governs every downstream dataflow: after
  rederivation, all execution-authorizing plan-unit facts (dispositions,
  kinds, owned paths, validators, structured-output refs, sources,
  dependencies, identity bindings) come only from the canonical rederived
  plan — never from a subsequent resolver lookup, so a hostile resolver can
  no longer substitute unit content into compiled assignments or
  composition. Validation-evidence construction and verification now also
  require the canonical authority inputs (a re-digested plan whose
  validators were rewritten can no longer produce or bless evidence, and
  ledger unit entries must mirror the canonical units exactly), the
  `ArtifactRevision` model itself scope-closes its plan-authority reference,
  cold resolution validates authority before reading any dependent closure
  document, parent revision, or content blob, and canonical-authority
  failures crossing the revision-store boundary surface as its typed error
  family.

### Added

- **Deterministic application-family rendering (ADR 0007 Slice 5D-0B2A)**: the
  offline semantic compiler can now render canonical application-configuration
  bytes for four application-level families — `app.json`,
  `ui/route_manifest.json`, `config/integrations.yaml`, and names-only
  `security/secrets.yaml` — from accepted semantic facts through a single
  binding-resolved `deterministic_app_config_renderer@1` authority with
  family-local render inputs, under two named byte contracts
  (`mozaiks.json_decl_bytes.v1`, `mozaiks.yaml_decl_bytes.v1`).
  `config/ai.json` is explicitly deferred: application-level AI-launch
  semantics (chat startup mode, workflow entry point) have no typed semantic
  home yet and are never inferred from per-workflow facts. Production
  generation is unchanged: AppGenerator writers remain the authoritative
  emitters of these paths until the atomic 5D cutover, and guards prove the
  new renderer is not wired into any production path.

### Fixed
- **Server-owned session fields and the canonical bundle entry are closed
  boundaries**: the chat-session lifecycle authority fields
  (`workflow_run_id`, `run_build_binding`, `build_terminal_receipt`) are now
  writable only through a privileged, lease-fenced persistence API — generic
  session creation with `extra_fields` rejects them deterministically before
  the idempotent existing-session return (a prohibited request never
  silently succeeds, whether the session exists or not), generic context
  persistence drops them with a logged security diagnostic, and the replay
  merge preserves them past workflow-declared context policy without ever
  accepting generic writes. A worker that lost its chat execution lease to a
  successor can no longer replace the successor's lifecycle authority. The
  app-bundle manifest now has an exact canonical bundle-entry identity: the
  record must be the canonical `app_bundle`/`app_bundle` BuildRecord, its
  persisted bundle name must satisfy the closed shared name grammar (ASCII
  letters/digits/hyphen/underscore), and the single `application/zip` entry
  must sit at exactly `{bundle_name}/{bundle_name}.zip` — one shared formula
  used by both the manifest writer and the resolver. A digest may never be
  validated against "any manifest entry with this digest"; wrong-family
  records, wrong archive basenames, dot-segment names, duplicate archives,
  digest-less entries, and mislocated archives all fail the build closed at
  registration.

### Fixed
- **A present but invalid `config/subscriptions.yaml` now fails application
  loading instead of silently disabling entitlement enforcement**: AppLoader
  previously caught the subscription contract's load error, logged a warning,
  and continued with no subscription config — which wired
  `NoOpEntitlementAdapter` and granted every `entitlement_gate`
  unconditionally. An invalid present contract (malformed YAML, unknown
  fields, wrong schema version, broken plan/default/product/wallet
  references) now raises `AppLoadError` and the platform host refuses to
  start. An absent file is unchanged: a valid non-SaaS app with no
  enforcement configured. Both `mozaiks.subscriptions.v1` and
  `mozaiks.subscriptions.v2` remain accepted, unchanged —
  `load_subscriptions_config` stays the sole schema authority.

- **Generated Mongo documents no longer break HTTP responses**: module action
  results are normalized at the ModuleExecutor boundary so BSON `ObjectId`
  *values* become their stable 24-character hexadecimal strings wherever
  they occur as values — `_id`, ordinary fields, nested documents, and
  arrays — and `Decimal128` values become their lossless decimal strings.
  JSON object keys must already be exact strings: an `ObjectId` key, like
  every other non-string mapping key, is rejected with a typed
  `MODULE_RESULT_NOT_JSON_SAFE` outcome — no key normalization or coercion
  occurs, so no post-normalization key collision is possible; the key domain
  is closed before iteration. Generated apps that list or read Mongo-backed
  records — whose documents carry a driver-generated `ObjectId` `_id` —
  previously produced a bare HTTP 500 at serialization on every read path
  (module routes, profile panels/tabs, page hydration). Datetimes and other
  JSON-encodable values keep their existing wire semantics through explicit
  closed conversions, unknown value types fail closed with the same typed
  outcome (no repr leaks), cyclic or absurdly nested results are rejected
  instead of exhausting the stack, and the response-size gate now measures
  the exact strictly-encoded UTF-8 bytes (no `default=str` masking). Input
  documents are not mutated. The container domain is closed to exact
  `dict`/`list`/`tuple`: sets and frozensets (no deterministic JSON form),
  container subclasses, custom Mappings, and generators are rejected before
  any iteration can run hostile code, and BSON `Int64` converts to the exact
  builtin int. Non-finite `Decimal` values (NaN/Infinity), failing pydantic
  serializers, malformed UTF-8 bytes, and unexpected conversion failures all
  surface as the same typed error — never a raw exception — with hostile
  payload contents kept out of error messages. The size gate's encoding is
  byte-for-byte identical to what Starlette's `JSONResponse` emits (compact
  separators, `ensure_ascii=False`, UTF-8), verified against real
  `TestClient` response bodies, so a result at the limit passes and one byte
  over fails.

### Changed

- **Self-versioned workflow documents**: `orchestrator.yaml` now requires
  `schema_version: mozaiks.orchestrator.v1`; `structured_outputs.yaml` requires
  `schema_version: mozaiks.structured_outputs.v1`. Public parsers retain the
  exact version and reject missing, null, unsupported, or altered spellings.
  OSS workflows, producers, examples, and authoring guidance migrate together.
  App workspaces must migrate their documents when upgrading; there is no
  unversioned fallback. Whole-document identity changes, while compiled output
  models, workflow interfaces, and unrelated compiler units retain identity.
- Upgraded the AG2 runtime to 1.0.3, including ACP 0.12.1 compatibility and corrected usage-event accounting coverage.

### Fixed

- **Structured-output caches now invalidate on workflow reload**: the compiled
  Pydantic model, registry, and structured-agent caches in
  `mozaiksai.core.workflow.outputs.structured` were never invalidated by
  `reload_workflow`, `unload_workflow`, or `refresh_all`, so after a YAML
  reload the workflow manager served the new configuration while
  structured-output validation kept enforcing models compiled from the old
  one. The structured-output subsystem now owns an explicit invalidation seam
  (`invalidate_workflow_structured_outputs` /
  `invalidate_all_workflow_structured_outputs`) that atomically drops all
  compiled state for a workflow, and the manager invokes it from every
  configuration-changing lifecycle operation — `reload_workflow`,
  `unload_workflow`, `refresh_all`, and `initialize_workflows` (root
  switches/reinitialization). A reload whose replacement configuration fails
  validation now fails closed on every lifecycle surface: the prior config,
  loaded-workflow record, and compiled models are evicted, and the manager
  records one explicit error-state entry instead of continuing to report the
  prior workflow as successfully loaded.

### Added

- **Executable application-family contracts (ADR 0007 Slice 5D-0B1)**:
  the offline compiler now declares truthful per-family dispositions,
  mutually exclusive application/module/workflow path scopes, typed artifact
  and integration implementation relations, narrow family-specific assignment
  kinds, schema-pinned closed outputs, semantic identity bindings, and exact
  validator ownership. `CompilationPlan.gaps` remains the literal emitted gap
  set; latent diagnostics are separate. The canonical integration path is now
  `config/integrations.yaml`. No renderer, runnable bundle, AG2 execution,
  production cutover, evaluation, or hosted-product authority was added;
  `AppBuildPlan` remains the live planning authority.

- **Typed application and workflow semantic input closure (ADR 0007 Slice
  5D-0A)**: graph-v2 now has closed application, provider-neutral auth,
  application-integration, and logical workflow-topology payloads plus finite
  optional-family selection/absence evidence. The offline projector consumes
  current application schema, persisted integration-declaration, and workflow
  bundle contracts without consulting `AppBuildPlan`, Git, hosted state, or
  AG2 runtime identity. The sole layout registry records the corresponding
  future source footprints. Production planning, rendering, execution,
  persistence/publication, and capability advertisement remain unchanged;
  downstream assignment and renderer gaps remain explicit for Slice 5D-0B.

- **Offline immutable artifact revisions (ADR 0007 Slice 5C)**: added a closed,
  content-addressed `ArtifactRevision` contract binding graph, implementation
  binding, CompilationPlan, CompositionLedger, validation evidence, exact
  bytes, and parent lineage. An isolated `ApplicationPublication` store uses a
  generation-guarded Mongo compare-and-swap so concurrent Genesis or sibling
  candidates cannot both become CURRENT. Cold restore verifies every blob and
  canonical digest; validator receipts now bind to the exact assignment result
  they validated. The substrate remains deliberately production-unwired:
  AppBuildPlan and BuildRecord still own live planning/publication until Slice
  5D, and no AG2 behavior changes.

- **Offline assignment artifact composition (ADR 0007 Slice 5B)**: added a
  pure Factory-participant admission resolver, closed structured-output and
  validator-backed `AssignmentArtifactResult`, and a content-free canonical
  `CompositionLedger` paired with runtime bundle bytes. Composition now proves
  exact plan-unit/path accounting, collision-free ownership, base-artifact
  reuse, and explicit removal in offline tests. The obsolete parallel
  `WorkAssignment` worker/executor/retry prototype was removed. Production
  remains unwired: AppBuildPlan still owns live planning and AG2 still owns
  participant identity and task lifecycle.

- **Offline executable plan contracts (ADR 0007 Slice 5A)**: CompilationPlan
  registry snapshots and family units now pin closed assignment-kind,
  validator, and workflow structured-output identities for bounded
  `agent_author` units. Aggregate-only `PlanUnitRef` resolution, exact semantic
  source/dependency context references, and the replacement
  `ApprovedAssignmentSpec` compiler derive paths and dependencies solely from
  cold-validated plan authority. Regeneration reuse also pins the complete
  authoring contract, including the resolved structured-output schema digest,
  so a contract change cannot silently reuse stale agent-authored bytes. The
  substrate remains deliberately unwired:
  AppBuildPlan is still the sole production planning authority, AG2 executes no
  new work, and deterministic Slice 4C materialization rejects `agent_author`.

- **ADR 0008 (Proposed): Deterministic Engineering Context** — documents the
  entitlement contract for software-engineering assignments (Mozaiks owns
  WHAT an assignment may know; AG2 owns HOW it becomes runtime context), the
  prompt/schema/Skills authoring policy, retrieval grants, symbolic context
  budget classes, the determinism boundary, AppGenerator decomposition and
  user-facing-state rules, the superseded-mechanism cleanup discipline, and
  slice placement (no 4C impact; Slice 5 landing-zone grammars; post-Slice-5
  implementation; Slice 6 closure-driven scoping). Companion evidence
  inventory at docs/architecture/workflows/appgenerator-context-debt.md.
  Documentation only — no runtime behavior changes.

- **Deterministic offline page materialization (ADR 0007 Slice 4C)**: a pure
  renderer materializes canonical `app_ui_page_schema` bytes from a validated
  graph-v2 payload closure, its CompilationPlan unit's complete source
  footprint, and the accepted graph-v2 ImplementationBinding — with one
  canonical serialization (declaration-order YAML, omitted absent facts,
  UTF-8/LF, no timestamps or provenance) proven byte-identical across
  repeated runs, reordered inputs, and fresh processes. Implementation
  resolution fails closed on any missing, wrong-family, wrong-materializer,
  wrong-version, or wrong-graph binding with no fallback to historical
  generators. `preserve_unowned` units place exact digest-verified bytes via
  the existing `ChildContractRef` identity (empty files preserved, tampering
  rejected); unsupported families stay typed gaps or explicit
  handoff/deferred/unsupplied reports — nothing is silently omitted or
  invented. Selective rematerialization drives the 4B regeneration closure: a
  linked semantic section change rerenders only the affected page unit while
  every unaffected output is reused byte-for-byte, and the proof suite
  validates, loads, and boots both the base and successor bundles through the
  real acceptance gate, `AppLoader`, and platform lifespan. Offline-only:
  no AG2 imports, no AppBuildPlan consultation, no production wiring — the
  agent-produced `AppBuildPlan` remains the sole operational authority until
  the Slice 5 cutover.

- **Renderer-input closure prerequisite (ADR 0007 Slice 4C, offline-only)**:
  graph-v2 page payloads now retain the canonical page identifier, route,
  page type, layout, shell mode, roles, navigation, metadata, and validated
  runtime section declaratives required to reconstruct the bounded page-schema
  corpus without invention. CompilationPlan units pin complete canonical
  linked-node and edge footprints; renderer-incomplete families remain typed
  gaps, while opaque executable/model-authored UTF-8 bytes are preserved
  exactly under digest-matched `ChildContractRef` identities. The existing
  layout registry now declares truthful materializer categories, and the
  implementation binding pins graph-v2-compatible materializer/family
  implementation versions. This adds no renderer, production cutover, or
  capability advertisement; AppBuildPlan remains runtime authority.

- **Aggregate CompilationPlan derivation (ADR 0007 Slice 4B, offline-only)**:
  one deterministic authoritative plan per immutable graph identity, derived
  solely from validated graph-v2 semantics, typed payloads, and the sole
  layout registry. Embedded family-instance plans are non-authoritative
  subdocuments (no reference type, registration, or execution surface of
  their own); every registry family row is disposed (render /
  reuse-from-base / preserve-unowned / input-only / external-handoff /
  inapplicable) or carried as an explicit typed gap — binding-owned
  conditions and renderer resolution defer to the next slice, never guessed.
  Portable-path output ownership with case-fold and prefix collision
  rejection, dependency ordering from the registry's total order, complete
  digest closure (payload -> graph -> plan Merkle chain), and a pure
  regeneration-closure function that partitions plan units into
  affected/reusable/added/removed for Refinement Runs without touching
  production refinement authority. The agent-produced AppBuildPlan remains
  the sole active operational plan; no production code consumes the new
  contract and no capability is advertised.

### Fixed

- **Generated application containers now boot through the packaged OSS platform host**:
  AppGenerator's provider-neutral Dockerfile uses
  `mozaiks serve . --host platform` with the declared listen address and
  container port, so a standalone exported workspace starts without an
  undeclared repository-local launcher. CI resolves the packaged CLI
  entrypoint and smoke-tests a representative materialized app image against
  MongoDB through health, page, and module-action requests.

- **Distributed same-chat exclusion is now enforced (issue #426, sub-slice A)**:
  the MongoDB chat lock at
  `mozaiksai/core/runtime/persistence/distributed_lock.py` — previously dead
  code with zero call sites — is rebuilt as a renewable chat execution lease
  and wired into every production start/resume/restart path (the
  `handle_user_input_from_api` funnel: HTTP input, WebSocket start/switch
  handlers, host auto-start, journey spawns, and live paused-run
  continuation). At most one runtime instance can execute a mutable run for a
  given `(app_id, chat_id)` at a time; distinct chats and tenants proceed
  independently, and read-only paths (history replay, reconnect) take no
  lock. The lease is renewed for the length of the protected operation,
  released at a durably persisted terminal or human-waiting boundary
  (including on exceptions and cancellation), and a stale holder can never
  delete a successor's lease. After confirmed lease loss (failed or
  unprovable renewal), the protected execution is cancelled and further
  durable session, workflow UI, AG2 stream, and AG2 Network knowledge/WAL
  writes for that chat are refused in-process. A still-running local holder
  cannot be hidden by a same-process successor. Operating modes are explicit: `required`
  (fail-closed distributed exclusion whenever database persistence is
  enabled; index or acquisition-authority failures remain distinct from
  ordinary contention and fail closed instead of degrading to a cosmetic
  lock) and `local` (explicit
  single-process serialization only), overridable via
  `MOZAIKS_CHAT_LOCK_MODE`. Contention, unavailable authority, renewal loss,
  and release failure each emit distinct diagnostics (`CHAT_LOCK_BUSY`,
  `CHAT_LOCK_AUTHORITY_UNAVAILABLE`, `CHAT_LOCK_RENEWAL_LOST`,
  `CHAT_LOCK_RELEASE_FAILED`). Lock documents now live in the same system
  database as the chat state they protect. One residual window remains
  documented and out of this slice: storage-level fencing tokens for a
  single in-flight write by a holder stalled past its TTL.

### Added

- **Projection emits graph v2 + typed payloads (ADR 0007 Slice 3E)**: the
  offline source projection now produces `mozaiks.semantic_projection.v2` —
  a Merkle-rooted `mozaiks.semantic_graph.v2` with one typed payload per node
  and bijective payload closure validated at build. Former "not representable
  by SemanticGraph v1" gap families become projected content: page/section
  ordering as explicit dense positions, plan/limit/meter/product facts
  (integer minor-unit prices, ISO-4217 currency), module/action/permission/
  event descriptions, and endpoint trigger bindings. Content is never
  invented — payload content fields are required-nullable (`None` when the
  source carries no such fact, omission is invalid), and absent collections
  remain distinct from explicitly empty collections while structural rules
  stay strict. Facts
  owned by edges or taxonomy are never duplicated into payloads. Navigation
  ordering, plan catalog ordering, intra-section binding composition, and
  renderer file lists remain explicit typed gaps. The source/graph fact
  equivalence proof now covers payload content digests, so projection honesty
  extends to content, not just identity.

- **Typed semantic payloads + Merkle-rooted graph v2 (ADR 0007 Slice 2E)**:
  every semantic node kind now has exactly one strict payload variant
  (`mozaiks.semantic_payload.v1` — titles/intent text, typed field shapes,
  integer minor-unit prices with ISO-4217 codes, explicit dense-position ordering, taxonomy-
  validated event/capability ids, portable-path-validated paths; no untyped
  dicts), pinned into `mozaiks.semantic_graph.v2` nodes by a full-identity
  `SemanticPayloadRef` so the graph digest is a Merkle root — any payload byte
  change re-roots the graph. The reference resolver cold-validates payload and
  graph model instances before mutation, registers payloads as immutable
  content-bearing subjects, and requires complete payload closure before a v2
  graph registers; there is no "current"/latest payload lookup. Semantic
  payloads and the layout registry consume one shared leaf `StubKind` authority.
  Graph v1 is byte-for-byte unchanged (golden vectors), no production code
  consumes the new symbols, and no compiler capability is advertised.

- **Portable path, registry v2, and deterministic archive substrate (ADR 0007
  Slice 4A)**: compiler-owned outputs now share one host-independent
  `mozaiks.portable_path.v1` profile (POSIX separators, NFC normalization,
  Windows-compatible restrictions on every host, case-folded duplicate and
  file/directory-prefix collision detection, fail-closed rejection of
  absolute/drive/UNC/traversal/glob/reserved/control-character/trailing-dot
  paths). ZIP becomes a deterministic transport envelope — STORED entries in
  canonical byte order with pinned timestamps and permissions, byte-identical
  across hosts and processes, verified fail-closed against every non-canonical
  metadata field (compression method, create_system, permissions and type
  bits, extra fields, comments, name-encoding flags, timestamps) plus
  link/directory/out-of-order/non-portable entries, with a closing check that
  the bytes equal the canonical serialization of their own entries — and is
  never a semantic authority. The
  application layout registry evolves in place to `mozaiks.app_layout.v2`:
  artifact families gain bounded stub-kind and dependency-family declarations,
  the registry self-digest covers them, dependency closure is validated
  acyclic, and `ordered_families()` provides a deterministic
  dependency-respecting total order. No semantic or planning authority
  changes: generators, `AppBuildPlan`, workflow execution, persistence, and
  promotion remain exactly as before, and no capability is advertised.

### Changed

- **App lifecycle terminology now centers Genesis Builds and Refinement Runs.**
  Public docs use Genesis Build for an app's first canonical build journey and
  Refinement Run for every later change in that app lineage, while Refinement
  Engine remains the internal routing and contract term.

- **Importing `mozaiksai.hosts.studio` no longer mutates the process
  environment.** Repo-local Studio defaults (`PLATFORM_PATH`,
  `MOZAIKS_WORKFLOWS_PATH`) and OpenTelemetry configuration are now applied
  exactly once at server startup — before runtime and platform startup run —
  instead of at module import time. Because the global workflow catalog is
  built when `mozaiksai.core.workflow.workflow_manager` is imported, Studio
  startup now also rebinds that catalog to the workflow root its defaults
  select, so `mozaiks serve <workspace> --host studio` still serves the shared
  factory workflow catalog rather than the workspace's own `workflows/` root.
  The `uvicorn mozaiksai.hosts.studio:app` entrypoint, `mozaiks serve`, and
  app-local host composition keep their existing behavior; caller-provided
  environment values keep precedence, and embedders that only import the host
  module no longer see their environment rewritten.

### Added

- **Offline semantic projection comparison (ADR 0007 Slice 3)**: deterministic,
  input-immutable adapters accept current AppGenerator, DesignDocs,
  subscription, module, page/route, AgentGenerator bundle, deployment,
  recorded-AppBuildPlan, and AppContext ownership shapes. They project only
  graph-v1 facts and report every other source fact through typed,
  machine-readable coverage and gaps; unresolved action, event, capability,
  scope, and ownership references fail closed instead of creating graph facts,
  as do duplicate canonical root aliases. Build-context and recorded workflow
  envelopes are accepted as provenance and classified entirely as typed gaps —
  they declare no graph-v1 identity and cannot by themselves produce a graph.
  Page bindings outside `/api/modules/{module}/{action}` are retained as typed
  gaps rather than invented action targets, so any valid AppPageSchema api path
  projects. Surface realization kinds that graph v1 cannot retain are likewise
  precise typed gaps rather than falsely reported as represented, and custom
  route identities retain their current AppSchema producer paths. Projection
  requires an explicitly pinned Slice 1
  `TaxonomyRegistry`, which keeps the call free of runtime, workflow, and
  workflow-catalog side effects. Production generators, hosts, loaders, Studio,
  workflows, control-plane code, capability advertisement, and runtime
  authority remain unchanged.

- **Semantic-compiler contract layer (ADR 0007 Slice 2)**: strict, immutable,
  content-digested contracts for `ApplicationManifest`
  (`mozaiks.app_manifest.v1`), `SemanticGraph` (`mozaiks.semantic_graph.v1`),
  and `ImplementationBinding` (`mozaiks.implementation_binding.v1`), plus the
  full typed reference roster (`ApplicationManifestRef`, `SemanticGraphRef`,
  `ImplementationBindingRef`, `CompilationPlanRef`, `BuildContextBindingRef`,
  `TaxonomyNamespaceRef`, `RefinementPatchRef`, `ArtifactRevisionRef`, and
  typed child-contract refs), one canonical serialization/digest contract
  (`mozaiks.canonical_json.v1`), deterministic node/edge identity, and
  fail-closed reference resolution and graph-closure validation in
  `mozaiksai.core.semantics`. The package sits behind non-production/test
  seams: no generator, runtime, or refinement code consumes it, and the ADR
  0006/0007 compiler capabilities (`semantic_taxonomy_v1`,
  `semantic_reference_contracts_v1`) remain unadvertised because Slice 1
  taxonomy validation has not yet passed outside advisory mode.

- **Advisory semantic taxonomy (`mozaiks.taxonomy.v1`)**: development and
  test callers can now validate registered event, capability, and artifact-
  family identifiers consistently across module loading, subscriptions,
  layout resolution, and event dispatch. Production name enforcement remains
  unchanged while later ADR 0007 authority-cutover slices are pending, and
  outbound dispatcher envelopes now declare `mozaiks.ui.event.v1` explicitly.

- **Coding provider observability**: ACP provider executions now capture a
  bounded list of operational events (plan updates, tool invocations, mode
  changes — model reasoning is never recorded) on the
  `StagedPatchProposal`, and the coding worker persists a
  `coding_provider` execution record (provider id, model, token usage,
  dispatch attempts, events) into both the worker result metadata and the
  artifact commit metadata, making provider activity reviewable and
  auditable from the artifact record. Token-usage *ledger* wiring is
  deferred: AG2 middleware owns token accounting, and attaching it to the
  provider's agent is tracked as an AG2 upgrade watchpoint rather than a
  parallel Mozaiks accounting path.
- **Promotion now triggers an App Intelligence refresh**: promoting an
  artifact into the live app root enqueues a context index job automatically
  (best-effort, reported in the promote response as
  `app_intelligence_refresh`) — previously the refresh was a manual three-step
  operator flow, so every refinement cycle after a promotion classified,
  scoped, and validated against a stale context snapshot.

### Security

- **Coding-produced artifacts can no longer be promoted or accepted with a
  validation override**: artifacts created by the refinement coding lane
  (structured or ACP provider output) require `validation_status='passed'`;
  the `allow_validation_override` escape hatch now returns 409 for them
  instead of letting unvalidated model output into the live app root.

- **Deterministic coding-provider selection with a fail-closed fallback
  ladder**: the refinement coding worker now dispatches each approved patch to
  a provider via pure policy (`select_coding_provider`) — the ACP provider is
  chosen only for multi-file scopes on `app_bundle`/`theme_config` artifacts
  within its configured budget, and only when it is enabled and installed;
  everything else stays on the structured-output provider. Operational ACP
  failures (unavailable, failed, empty, timeout, budget exceeded) fall back to
  the structured provider exactly once; an out-of-scope ACP result
  (`rejected_scope`) surfaces as a failure and never retries. Every attempt is
  recorded in result metadata (`coding_provider_attempts`). With the ACP
  provider disabled (the default), dispatch is byte-identical to before.

- **ACP-backed CLI coding provider (dark)**: `ACPCodingProvider` drives an
  ACP-compatible coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) for one bounded
  turn inside a disposable staged workspace, then accepts only what the
  deterministic hash harvest verifies — out-of-scope edits, timeouts, empty
  results, and budget overruns all fail closed with typed statuses. Headless
  hardening is explicit: allowlisted subprocess env (provider API keys only),
  `expose_tools=False`, terminal capability not advertised,
  `elicitation_policy="decline"`. Disabled by default in refinement policy,
  packaged behind the new optional `mozaiks[acp-coding]` extra
  (`agent-client-protocol` pinned to 0.12.0 — 0.12.1 breaks ag2 1.0.2's
  dispatcher import), and not yet reachable from any production path:
  provider selection ships separately.

- **Typed refinement lanes and coding provider policy**: the eight refinement
  lanes (`ui_patch`, `experience_design`, `feature_addition`, `integration`,
  `managed_capability_change`, `data_model_migration`, `architecture_replan`,
  `conceptual_reframe`) are now a canonical `RefinementLane` enum consumed by
  lane inference, promotion policy, context policy, and validation — replacing
  unpinned string literals. `refinement_policy.yaml` gains a
  `coding.providers` section declaring the opt-in ACP coding provider
  (disabled by default) with hard execution budgets (`max_files`,
  `max_diff_bytes`, `max_wall_seconds`, `max_retries`); credentials and
  adapter connection details are rejected by schema.

- **Coding workspace materializer and deterministic diff harvester**
  (`mozaiksai/control_plane/workspace.py`): scoped files are written into a
  disposable per-request workspace with pre-run sha256 manifests, and results
  are harvested from the real tree — symlinks, files outside the editable
  manifest, and deletions surface as typed scope violations instead of being
  accepted. Refinement artifact persistence now writes through this module,
  refuses secret-sensitive or unsafe scoped paths loudly instead of silently
  skipping them, and records per-file content hashes in artifact commit
  metadata. This is the enforcement layer ACP-backed coding providers will
  execute inside. The secret-sensitive path policy previously duplicated
  across staging, promotion, and scoped execution is now a single canonical
  helper (`is_secret_sensitive_path`) — the unified term list is the union of
  the old copies, so each call site is equal or stricter than before.

- **`CodingExecutionProvider` boundary in the refinement control plane**: the
  scoped coding worker now delegates patch production to a provider behind a
  typed, provider-neutral `StagedPatchProposal` contract. The first provider,
  `StructuredOutputCodingProvider`, preserves today's single-shot
  structured-output behavior exactly; the boundary is where ACP-backed CLI
  coding providers (Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode) plug in later without
  gaining routing, scope, acceptance, or promotion authority. The shared
  `safe_artifact_relpath` helper now also rejects drive-qualified and UNC
  paths, aligning the coding path with the staging module's path policy.

### Fixed

- **AG2 Network restart continuation now resumes interrupted agent turns.**
  Reopened chat-scoped Hubs reattach canonical Network identities and invoke
  AG2 pending-turn recovery before accepting further input. Workflow launch
  triggers now remain plain Network text instead of reconstructed Classic-style
  role/name messages, and retired user-proxy/manager identity aliases are no
  longer accepted by runtime routing or replay.

- **Continue Build now resumes the durable AG2 Network channel**: runtime
  continuation reopens the chat-scoped AG2 KnowledgeStore, hydrates the Hub
  WAL and transition state, and reattaches existing agent and human identities
  instead of projecting transcript messages into a new Network channel.
- **Generated custom-route clients now recognize real entitlement denials**:
  module-action and workflow-start failures unwrap FastAPI's structured
  `detail` envelope, so HTTP 402 responses reach the app's upgrade flow while
  flat object responses remain compatible. Declarative page rendering is
  unchanged.
- **Module-event workflow triggers now fail closed instead of amplifying**:
  each event/capability invocation is durably claimed before session creation,
  concurrent replay is suppressed, workflow-trigger lineage carries bounded
  depth and cycle ancestry, and Mongo-backed per-tenant admission limits reject
  runaway unique events without affecting other tenants. Replay, cycle/depth,
  rate, rate-authority, and persistence rejections emit distinct platform
  diagnostics.
- **ADR 0007 Slice 0 closes proven generator and refinement defects**:
  generated app/workflow writers now use the canonical build-scoped staging
  roots, required artifact and DesignDocs persistence fails closed, lineage
  queries and dependency families match persisted build-record fields, and
  launch-context authority failures no longer admit unvalidated context.
- **Generated SaaS plan limits now survive AppGenerator assembly and export**:
  `usage_limits` and `token_allowances` are preserved in
  `config/subscriptions.yaml`, and the canonical module API helper no longer
  creates a false missing-action failure during export acceptance.
- **Ask-mode messages now render immediately**: optimistic user messages and
  live assistant frames retain their general-chat provenance, so the active
  chat no longer hides either side until the persisted transcript is reloaded.
- **`mozaiks gen` burned tokens on runs it could never finish** (#383): the
  CLI takes one `--prompt` and has no way to reply, but AgentGenerator opens
  with `InterviewAgent`, which asks a clarifying question and hands the turn
  to `user`. Every run therefore stalled at `WORKFLOW_AWAITING_INPUT` with
  zero files written — after real LLM spend. `gen` now inspects the staged
  workflow's own declarative config before executing anything and refuses
  when the workflow can hand control to a user (`human_in_the_loop: true` in
  `orchestrator.yaml`, or a `transition_graph.yaml` edge targeting `user` /
  reverting to the user), redirecting to `mozaiks studio --dir . --open`.
  Detection is on the property, not the workflow name, so genuinely one-shot
  workflows still run and future interview-driven ones are covered.
  `--allow-interactive` bypasses the refusal for anyone who wants to start a
  run and drive it elsewhere.
- **Every workflow failed instantly under context-authority enforcement**:
  the routing-variable validation added in #298/#344 required deterministic
  writers that the runtime never actually produced — agent-sentinel triggers
  ("say NEXT") wrote as freeform `agent_text` and declared workflow tools
  wrote as `tool_writeback`/`context_bridge`, all banned for routing state.
  Every graph compile raised `ContextAuthorityError` before any agent spoke,
  so every Studio conversation "completed" in under a second with zero agent
  activity. The writer taxonomy is now complete: exact-match `equals`
  triggers write as a new deterministic `sentinel_text_trigger` writer
  (freeform contains/regex-capture stays banned from routing), auto-invoked
  tools write as `deterministic_tool`, closed routing/quality state accepts
  the deterministic tool/lifecycle/structured-output machinery, and the AG2
  runner elevates bridge/derive writes to the declared deterministic writer
  per variable. A new drift guard
  (`tests/test_workflow_context_authority_compile.py`) compiles all 14
  factory workflows against their real policies on every PR — the test that
  would have caught this before merge.
- **ExistingAppDiscovery crashed at persist time**: twelve context variables
  declared `type: object` with list defaults/values, which the replay type
  guard fail-closes on. Declarations corrected to `type: array`, and the new
  drift guard also validates every declared default against its declared
  type.
- **`mozaiks gen` no longer reports a silent no-op as success** (issue #379):
  the CLI now initialises real logging (workflow-engine INFO records and file
  sinks were previously swallowed), asserts on the orchestration result —
  failed runs, runs paused awaiting a user reply, and runs where no agent
  ever produced a turn now exit 1 with distinct messages — points
  `MOZAIKS_GENERATED_ARTIFACTS_PATH` at the CLI output directory so the
  empty-output check inspects where tools actually write, and warns loudly
  when `MONGO_URI` is unset. The orchestration result payload now carries
  `agents_created` / `agent_turns` evidence, echoed in the completion
  summary as `agents=N turns=M`.
- **Apps no longer shows a duplicate Create App action**: app creation remains
  available from the shell header while the Apps management page focuses on
  searching, filtering, and opening existing apps.
- **AppWorkbench live-preview refresh actually works now**: the preview
  sandbox API the workbench calls after a scoped refinement
  (`/api/artifacts/{id}/sandbox`, `/api/sandbox/*`, `/ws/sandbox/*`) was
  defined but never mounted by any host, so every refinement-triggered
  preview refresh failed with a 404 and the iframe kept showing the stale
  app. The session manager was promoted from workflow-local dead code to
  `mozaiksai/core/sandbox/preview_sessions.py` over the `SandboxPort` seam
  and the routes are mounted on the Studio host with auth. Because it now
  rides `SandboxPort`, the live-preview loop also works on local Docker —
  previously it was hard-wired to e2b, so OSS self-hosters had no live
  refresh at all.

### Added

- **Per-build usage attribution and emission counters**: runtime usage events
  now carry an optional `build_id` (read from the build-lifecycle context
  variable) so token cost can be rolled up per build, not just per chat or
  workflow. `TokenManager` also counts emission outcomes
  (`emitted` / `dropped_disabled` / `dropped_missing_context` / `failed`),
  exposes them via `get_usage_emission_stats()`, and logs a one-time warning
  per drop reason — a fully-dropped usage stream now announces itself instead
  of looking identical to a healthy one.

### Changed

- **Factory Studio demo mode now uses a three-app canonical fleet**: the six
  disconnected pseudo-app records were replaced by three accepted archetypes
  (authenticated CRUD, admin operations, and monetized AI SaaS). Usage,
  billing, deployment, users, activity, integrations, workflows, runs,
  sessions, and artifact history now stay closed over the same three app IDs,
  with current passing bundles and healthy deployed states for meaningful
  cross-portal testing.
- **AppWorkbench leads with the app, speaks the user's language**: the
  file-tree/editor/preview grid now renders directly under the status strip
  (previously it sat below the review and refinement panels), build logs
  default to collapsed unless validation failed, and the refinement panel's
  copy no longer leaks internal vocabulary ("control-plane harness",
  "codex-backed patch", artifact version ids) — it reads "Describe a change
  and the agents will patch your app." The preview pane gains a
  **Start live preview** button when no preview exists yet (boots the bundle
  in an e2b or Docker sandbox on demand), and `generate_and_download` now
  passes `app_id` so preview sandboxes are keyed to the app
  deterministically.
- **AppWorkbench pane naming and preview messaging cleaned up**: the internal
  panes of the Studio `AppWorkbench` artifact are now named `*Pane.js`
  (`PreviewPane`, `FileTreePane`, `CodeEditorPane`, `BuildStatusPane`) instead
  of the misleading `*Artifact.js`, since only `AppWorkbench` itself is a
  registered UI artifact. The preview pane's empty state now explains when a
  live preview is available (e2b or Docker sandbox validation) instead of
  referencing e2b internals. The workflow UI docs gain an explicit
  artifact-vs-pane naming convention.

- **README onboarding restructured around the documented first-run path**: the
  Quickstart now opens with a prerequisites list and five numbered steps
  (install, MongoDB, LLM key, `quickstart`, first app), and sits above the
  architecture deep-dive so a new reader reaches an install command without
  scrolling past runtime internals first. Adds a short troubleshooting list
  and a "Where To Go Next" table pointing at the Studio and guides pages.
- **README AG2 badge no longer claims a beta**: it now reads `1.0.1`, matching
  the pinned `ag2==1.0.1` dependency in `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.

### Added

- **Subscription contract refinement routing**: the refinement harness now has
  a `subscription_contract` build family. Post-build monetization change
  requests (plans, pricing tiers, entitlement gates) route to new
  `subscription_patch` (`SubscriptionContractDesigner → AppGenerator`) and
  `subscription_revision` (`SubscriptionContractDesigner → AgentGenerator →
  AppGenerator`) sequences instead of silently falling back to `app_bundle`
  routes that skipped the contract designer. New closure tests enforce that
  every harness route resolves to a declared sequence, every refinable family
  has explicit routes, and any sequence claiming to refresh
  `subscription_contract` actually runs SubscriptionContractDesigner.
- **Sandbox boundary, previews, and persistence**: codified the boundary
  between AG2 agent-level execution (`SandboxShellTool`) and Mozaiks-owned
  app-preview/validation sandboxes (`SandboxPort`) in the ownership-boundary
  and watchpoints docs, plus a consolidated
  `docs/architecture/builder/app-validation-sandboxes.md` (strategies, all
  env vars, hosted e2b activation and cost posture). Docker validation
  sandboxes now publish preview ports so `get_preview_url` works locally for
  free. Validation results persist `sandbox_session_id`/`sandbox_provider`,
  provider sandboxes are created with identity metadata and kill deadlines
  (closing the orphaned-sandbox billing vector), and `BuildRecord` gains
  queryable `app_validation_status` / `app_validation_strategy` /
  `sandbox_session_id` / `sandbox_provider` fields. The control-plane coding
  worker's unimplemented `e2b` validation label was removed so build records
  only claim strategies that actually ran.

### Fixed

- **Gemini is consistently the documented default LLM provider** (#367): the
  README quickstart now leads with `GEMINI_API_KEY` (matching
  `docs/getting-started.md` and `.env.example`), and the `quickstart` CLI's
  no-key warning checks and names `GEMINI_API_KEY` instead of telling Gemini
  users they have no API key.
- **SaaS bundles can no longer sell capabilities they never enforce**: the
  generated-bundle scanner now fails a bundle whose
  `config/subscriptions.yaml` grants plan capabilities while no module action
  declares an `entitlement_gate` — previously such bundles passed validation
  and shipped a decorative subscription contract. Token/usage-only plans
  (no capabilities) are unaffected.
- **Public /pricing page works anonymously in MozaiksPay SaaS apps**: the
  mozaikspay pack's `billing_portal.list_plans` action now declares
  `api_surface: public_readonly` with no permission requirement, so the
  pricing landing page can render the plan catalog before login. The scanner
  now also requires `ui/pages/pricing.yaml` in mozaikspay SaaS bundles and
  verifies it binds to `list_plans`.
- **Rejecting the subscription contract review no longer silently produces a
  non-SaaS build**: when a reviewer requests changes,
  SubscriptionContractDesigner now loops back to the designer agent to revise
  and re-submit instead of terminating without an approved contract, and the
  downstream generator context hook fails loudly if an unapproved
  (changes-requested) contract state ever reaches AppGenerator/AgentGenerator.

### Added

- **Monetized archetype proves the entitlement chain**: the generated-app
  archetype matrix now wires the monetized SaaS archetype with the real
  `ConfiguredEntitlementAdapter` and the platform billing fulfillment
  endpoint instead of a no-op checker, and asserts the full loop — gated
  action denied on the free default plan (402 ENTITLEMENT_REQUIRED),
  granted after a verified-provider `subscription_activated` fulfillment
  command applied through the app's own `/api/billing/fulfillment/apply`,
  and denied again after `subscription_cancelled`. The previous check
  (`status_code in {200, 402}`) passed regardless of whether entitlement
  enforcement existed at all.
- **Factory regression suite**: `factory_app/eval/` (bundle scorers + run
  persistence + baseline diff, upstreamed from the hosted product's
  build_intelligence bundle evaluation) and
  `tests/test_factory_regression_suite.py`, which materializes the five
  archetype-matrix app plans offline (no LLM, no network), scores every
  generated bundle deterministically, and fails CI when a check that passed
  on the committed baseline (`tests/fixtures/factory_bundle_eval_baseline.json`)
  regresses. Refresh deliberately with `REFRESH_FACTORY_EVAL_BASELINE=1` and
  commit the reviewed delta. A determinism guard asserts two
  materialize+score passes agree exactly.

- **Generic usage instrumentation and rollups**: the platform host records
  `app.page_view` (per page-schema serve) and `app.action_invoked` (per
  successful module action) into the app's own AppMetrics store —
  fire-and-forget, env-gated `MOZAIKS_USAGE_METRICS` (default on), no data
  leaves the app. `AppMetrics.usage_rollup(since, until)` aggregates them
  into daily buckets (page views, unique sessions, action invocations,
  active users). The mozaiks_cloud pack gains a sink-agnostic
  `cloud_usage_reporter` module template plus `mozaiks_cloud_usage_client`
  posting daily aggregate rollups to a configured Mozaiks Cloud-compatible
  operator endpoint (`POST /usage/rollups`, scope `cloud:usage`); when no
  connector or `MOZAIKS_CLOUD_*` configuration exists the reporter is
  silently idle — generated apps never phone home by default, and only
  aggregate counts are ever sent.

### Security

- **Fail-closed Mongo index readiness**: app data-contract indexes are now
  compared against materialized Mongo metadata by name, ordered keys, and the
  complete supported option set (`unique`, `sparse`, partial filters,
  collation, TTL, hidden state, and wildcard projection). Same-name mismatches
  and same-key definitions under another name abort startup; missing indexes are awaited,
  reread, and verified before readiness. Inspection and creation errors are no
  longer swallowed, and the runtime never drops conflicting indexes.

- **Module dispatch requires explicit authority**: `ModuleRequest.authority` is
  now a required keyword-only `ModuleDispatchAuthority`, and the
  `granted_permissions` field is removed along with the
  `from_granted_permissions()` translation shim and both compatibility
  authority kinds. Permission and entitlement enforcement key exclusively on
  `authority.permission_mode` and `authority.permissions`; a missing principal
  or empty permission list now denies closed instead of silently bypassing.
  Trusted bypass is restricted to a closed, constructor-validated set of
  server-owned kinds (`framework_internal`, `operator_internal`,
  contract-declared `event_reaction`, auth-disabled `local_development`);
  `local_development` cannot be constructed while authentication is enabled or
  the deployment environment is production. New `workflow_user_authority()` and
  `event_reaction_authority()` helpers are the canonical producers for workflow
  and event-reaction dispatch. `ModuleActionDispatchRequest.authority` is also
  required (keyword-only) and the facade's separate permission-list field is
  deleted: the caller's enforce-mode authority carries its permissions and is
  passed to `ModuleExecutor` exactly as supplied. `ModuleContext` receives
  `dispatch_authority`, `dispatch_provenance`, and `dispatch_audit` on every
  execution path, including caller-supplied contexts. Downstream apps
  constructing `ModuleRequest` or `ModuleActionDispatchRequest` directly must
  supply an explicit authority when they adopt this version.

### Removed

- Retired write-only workflow `module_interface.yaml` v1 generation and the
  non-materializing `agent_backend_integration` AppGenerator build-task type.
  Existing workflow metadata and module callbacks are unchanged.

- **Generated UI browser acceptance retired result vocabulary**: the
  `scripts/generated_ui_acceptance.py` output no longer exposes top-level
  `status`, `findings`, `revision_count`, or `revision_request` fields. Browser
  validation now returns the canonical `ValidationRun` and one
  `RepairDecision` (`accept`, `repair`, or `block`) from the shared acceptance
  controller. No aliases or compatibility translation are retained; consumers
  must read `validation_run.gate_results` and `repair_decision` before adopting
  this version.

- **`AppPageSchema.extensions` / `AppPageSlotExtension`**: the page slot-override
  contract is removed from structured outputs, generator prompts, and the UI
  quality audit. It was a schema-only promise — `PageRenderer` never rendered
  the field, no fixture or workspace used it, and no component-closure
  authority existed. Generated pages declaring `extensions` now fail bundle
  acceptance, and the quality audit flags the field for removal. Routes that
  primitives cannot express use `custom_route_bundle`.

### Added

- **`mozaiks.app_page.v1` runtime page validation** (`mozaiksai.core.runtime.app.page_schema`):
  canonical, strict Pydantic validation of every declarative page schema at `AppLoader` boot
  and at serve time. Apps with invalid page YAML fail to start rather than silently serving
  bad schemas.
  - `AppPageSchema` enforces `schema_version: mozaiks.app_page.v1`, 11 closed `page_type`
    values, 4 closed `layout` values, 26 registered primitives, and `extra="forbid"` on all
    nested config models. No unknown fields are silently accepted.
  - `AppLoader.load()` validates every `ui/pages/**/*.yaml` before boot completes; a
    `PageSchemaValidationError` aborts startup with a structured diagnostic.
  - `GET /api/pages/{name}` serves from the pre-validated boot cache; the disk-read fallback
    (dev/hot-reload) calls the identical canonical validator and returns `safe_page_schema_error_detail()`
    — no raw exception text, file paths, or tracebacks in HTTP responses.
  - `generated_ui_contract.audit_page_schemas()` and `generated_bundle_scanner` reuse the same
    canonical validator so generation, acceptance, and runtime share one contract.
  - Factory `page_plan_utils` injects `schema_version: mozaiks.app_page.v1` into every
    materialized page; `save_app_schema` validates against the runtime schema before writing.

- **Mozaiks UI v1 architecture constitution**
  (`docs/architecture/frontend/mozaiks-ui-v1.md`): the authoritative target
  documentation contract for the native UI framework — canonical surface kinds,
  single-owner layer map, registry constitution, target `mozaiks.ui.event.v1`
  requirements, state-domain ownership, the deterministic generation pipeline,
  extension checklists, security invariants, and a dependency-ordered roadmap.
  Documentation only; current implementation truth remains documented in the
  current-versus-target table; no runtime, schema, or registry behavior changed.

- **Canonical app layout registry v1** (`mozaiksai.core.runtime.app.layout_registry`):
  the first typed, versioned layout authority (`mozaiks.app_layout.v1`). Closed
  enums for artifact kind, owner, requirement, condition, path scope, materializer,
  validator, runtime consumer, and security class; deterministic digest-signed
  registry identity (prose and timestamps excluded); fail-closed path matching
  with specificity precedence, Unicode NFC normalization, and explicit
  prohibited-path families; bounded extension slots for managed-capability packs.
  Data-only in this release — not yet wired into `paths.py`, loaders,
  materializers, or prompts.

- **Mozaiks Cloud OSS connector contracts** (`factory_app/build_context/mozaiks_cloud/`):
  versioned, optional capability pack wiring generated apps to the Mozaiks Cloud
  managed platform for deployment, environment endpoints, and domain management.
  - `MozaiksCloudTransport` shared auth/retry/idempotency base; bounded sub-clients
    `MozaiksCloudDeploymentClient`, `MozaiksCloudEnvironmentClient`, and
    `MozaiksCloudDomainClient` in generated app bundles.
  - Provider API contract (`provider_api_contract.yaml`) with closed deployment/domain/TLS
    status enums, normalized error taxonomy, and globally forbidden response fields.
  - App-owned facade modules `cloud_deployment` and `cloud_domain` with bounded actions,
    declared events, and read-only reactions on `hosted.cloud.*` events.
  - Explicit-selection-only contract — pack never auto-selects; provider-neutral bundles
    contain zero cloud connector artifacts when the pack is not chosen.
  - `generated_bundle_scanner` extended with `_scan_mozaiks_cloud_connector_contract`
    and `_RAW_CLOUD_PROVIDER_IMPORT_RE` (Azure/Cloudflare SDK import guard).
  - `capability_directory.yaml` and `capability_routing.yaml` wired with `mozaiks_cloud`
    operator pack entry and `cloud_hosting` routing layer.

- **Crash-safe workflow-queue leases**: `MongoWorkflowQueue` now issues a
  unique `claim_token` (fencing token) on each claim, enforces bounded lease
  durations, and supports bounded retries with dead-letter terminal state.
  - Fenced `complete()` and `fail()`: only the current claim_token holder can
    transition a claimed item. Stale workers whose lease expired are rejected.
  - `renew_lease()` extends an active lease without reclaiming.
  - Configurable `max_attempts` and `retry_delay_seconds` per enqueued item.
  - Expired leases are atomically reclaimed by the next `claim_next()` call
    (crash recovery without a background sweeper).
  - Pre-upgrade records (no `claim_token`) are immediately reclaimable.
  - `ClaimResult` returned from `claim_next()` carries `claimed`, `item`,
    `claim_token`, and `attempt_count`.
  - No TTL index on lease fields; completed and dead-letter records remain
    available for audit.

- **Entitlement gate compile-time closure**: Generated app bundles with
  `config/subscriptions.yaml` now fail deterministic bundle validation if any
  `module.yaml` action declares an `entitlement_gate` capability_id that is not
  granted by at least one subscription plan. The platform wires
  `ConfiguredEntitlementAdapter` whenever `config/subscriptions.yaml` loads
  successfully; `assignment_store` controls persisted assignment lookup, not
  adapter selection. Previously such bundles passed validation but permanently
  denied the gated action at runtime for every user.
  - Per-action diagnostics name the module path, action id, and unresolvable
    capability_id, and suggest typo near-matches from the declared plan catalog.
  - Apps without `subscriptions.yaml` remain ungated via `NoOpEntitlementAdapter`.
    Malformed `subscriptions.yaml` files are not treated as custom/dynamic
    adapter declarations.
  - `PlanDef` in `subscriptions_loader` now rejects plans that list the same
    `capability_id` more than once (duplicate conflicting declarations).
  - The bundle scanner derives plan grants from the canonical
    `SubscriptionsConfig` loader output, covering both v1 (flat `plans[]`) and
    v2 (`products[].plans[]`) subscriptions schema.
  - 36 tests in `tests/test_entitlement_gate_closure.py` cover all scenarios:
    positive (valid gated actions, multi-plan grants, `assignment_store`-absent
    configured catalogs, ungated app, no-action bundle) and negative (unknown
    gate, near-match typo, ungranted capability, all-plans-empty, malformed
    YAML, multi-module multi-failure deterministic ordering, duplicate
    capabilities).

- **Community Component Foundation v1**: Extended capability packs to carry versioned identity and machine-readable dependency declarations without introducing a parallel component runtime.
  - `context.yaml` pack blocks now require `version`; `author`, `license`, and `source` remain optional metadata.
  - `contract.yaml` supports the canonical `requires.packs` / `requires.capabilities` block for machine-readable dependency declarations; exact `requires.packs[].version` values are enforced when present.
  - `resolve_managed_capability_templates()` verifies local packs before materialization, computes one canonical `sha256:` content digest from declared pack assets, and emits `.mozaiks/pack_provenance.json` with `pack_id`, `version`, `source`, `digest`, and `materialized_owned_files`.
  - Structural allowlisting of `context.yaml` pack blocks via `validate_pack_context()` now rejects unexpected root, asset, and pack-block keys before any pack data reaches AG2.
  - `scan_generated_bundle()` now validates the provenance manifest schema when `.mozaiks/pack_provenance.json` is present in a generated bundle.
  - `.mozaiks` added to `CANONICAL_APP_ROOT_DIRS` so the provenance directory is a first-class part of the canonical app surface.
  - First-party packs (`messaging`, `support`, `social`, `commerce`, `notifications`, `files`, `entitlement_dispatch`, `mozaikspay`, `operator_readiness`, `onboarding`) updated to `version: "0.1.11"`.
  - `support/contract.yaml` migrated from informal `required_packs` to canonical `requires.packs` format.
  - Fixture community packs in `tests/fixtures/community_packs/` prove dependency validation and provenance work locally without App Zero, network, or a paid LLM.
  - 49 tests in `tests/test_community_pack_foundation.py` cover schema validation, digest stability, tamper rejection, provenance emission,
    bundle scanner integration, retired-shape rejection, and first-party pack behavior.

- Published `docs/architecture/MOZAIKS_OSS_SOFTWARE_DESIGN.md` as the authoritative OSS north-star software-design document; added to mkdocs.yml navigation as the primary architecture reference. No competing document exists under `docs/architecture/foundations/`.

- Proved clean-room self-host experience end-to-end: a fresh `pip install -e ".[dev]"` on a clean clone boots Studio, loads all 14 factory workflows, and passes the clean-room self-host acceptance suite without private config or BlocUnited infrastructure. Added `tests/test_selfhost_clean_install.py` with 15 deterministic CI smoke tests covering install, CLI entry, factory resources, startup warning quality, no-fork guard, and self-host docs presence.
- Fixed startup validator to route by `LLM_PRIMARY_API_TYPE`: the provider-specific API-key check now names the correct env var per provider (`GEMINI_API_KEY / GOOGLE_API_KEY` for google, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for anthropic, `OPENAI_API_KEY` for openai). Previously always warned about `OPENAI_API_KEY` even when `.env.example` defaults to Gemini free tier.
- Enforced pre-1.0 OSS/proprietary boundary as an architecture contract: added `docs/adr/0003-pre-1-0-oss-proprietary-boundary-freeze.md` ("DIFFERENT INTELLIGENCE, SAME CANONICAL APP"), `docs/architecture/foundations/oss-boundary-families.md` (authoritative DO-NOT-MOVE family registry), and `tests/test_oss_boundary_policy.py` (governance guard).
- Added generated-app archetype regression matrix (`tests/test_generated_app_archetype_matrix.py`) covering Level-2 acceptance across authenticated CRUD, monetized SaaS, workflow/agent, admin/operations dashboard, community/content, and AppPlan materialization archetypes.
- Added `scripts/package_content_guard.py`: artifact-level content guard that inspects built wheels and sdists before publication. Fails on learned-artifact directories (`evals/`, `corpora/`, `corrections/`, `production_outcomes/`, `learned_rankings/`, `customer_patterns/`, etc.), raw private keys, raw provider credentials (`sk_live_`, `sk_test_`, etc.), `.env` files (non-example), private-key file extensions (`.pem`, `.key`), and unapproved top-level package families or `factory_app/` sub-families. Warns on large data files and review-pattern paths.
- Added `scripts/run_release_audit.py`: local pre-release audit script that chains governance guardrails, build, package content guard, twine check, smoke install into a clean venv, Factory resource resolution verification, and offline functional acceptance tests. Run with `python scripts/run_release_audit.py` before tagging any release.
- Added `docs/adr/0002-appgenerator-baseline-strategy-oss.md`: records the intentional decision to publish the AppGenerator baseline strategy as OSS. Establishes that future learned or operator-derived additions require a new publication review ADR before entering this repository.
- Added deterministic brownfield and AgentGenerator handoff acceptance coverage proving captured post-reasoning artifacts can flow through AppGenerator materialization and Level-2 generated-app runtime acceptance offline.

### Security

- Extended `scripts/governance_guardrails.py` with learned-artifact quarantine enforcement at the source level: data files (`.jsonl`, `.csv`, `.parquet`, `.pkl`, etc.) inside quarantine directories are now a governance ERROR; code files inside those directories are a NOTICE. Complements the artifact-level guard in `package_content_guard.py`.
- Added package content guard step to `.github/workflows/release.yml` between `twine check` and wheel install smoke test. Inspects all built artifacts for prohibited content before any publication step.
- Disabled tag-triggered releases in `.github/workflows/release.yml`: the `release` GitHub environment has no required reviewers (`protection_rules: []`), meaning any `v*` tag push would have auto-published. The tag trigger is now commented out; only a manual `workflow_dispatch` with `confirm_release: "release-confirmed"` can proceed. Add environment reviewers and uncomment the tag trigger when ready to ship.

### Changed

- Updated `docs/releasing.md` with an explicit "RELEASES ARE CURRENTLY DISABLED" banner, verified NOT PROTECTED release gate status (with remediation steps), a full Pre-Release Checklist (P0/P1), and a Release-Candidate Audit Command section documenting `scripts/run_release_audit.py`.
- Updated `MANIFEST.in` with a comment block documenting the agent-guidance split policy: `mozaiks_cli/agent_guidance/` (user-facing skills, ships in wheel) vs `.claude/skills/` (contributor-only framework skills, git-only, not shipped).

### Added

- Added the App Intelligence Plane: source-backed indexing now produces an `app_intelligence_snapshot` artifact alongside `source_context_bundle` and `app_context_graph`, with discovery and refinement tools exposing compact architecture, capability, ownership, integration, data, and risk context before agents read exact files.
- Added a provider-neutral generated app auth contract (`app/config/auth.yaml`) and hardened OIDC PKCE adapter output so authenticated apps keep auth behavior deterministic while leaving provider setup to operators or hosted services.
- Added workspace handler extension system: `workspace_extensions_contract.yaml` declares the schema for `app/build_context/{pack_id}/extensions.yaml` files that workspace apps use to express extra params, param overrides, and extra actions on top of OSS-generated base handlers without editing generated files.
- All capability packs (social, messaging, commerce, entitlement_dispatch, mozaikspay/billing_portal, support) now ship a `base_handler.py` / `handler.py` split: the base class contains the full implementation and is always regenerated; the workspace subclass is a thin preserved subclass for app-local overrides. `contract.yaml` for each pack declares `base_handler.py` as `owner: templates` and `handler.py` as `owner: workspace`.
- AppGenerator agents now carry the handler split rule so generated apps always scaffold both files correctly.

### Fixed

- Fixed workflow run context persistence and replay to require resolved workflow
  declarations, omit non-persisted authority fields, reject malformed known
  values, safely drop stale unknown keys, and surface required storage failures.
- Fixed `validate_module_implementation_contract` to resolve handler methods through single-level base class inheritance within the same module's `backend/` directory. The `base_handler.py`/`handler.py` split pattern previously caused the acceptance gate to report every action as missing a handler method on the thin workspace subclass.
- Fixed messaging and support pack `module.yaml` handler entrypoints: after the `base_handler.py`/`handler.py` split renamed workspace subclasses from `MessagesModule`/`SupportModule` to `MessagesHandler`/`SupportHandler`, `module.yaml` still declared the old class names, causing `ModuleLoadError` at runtime and in tests.
- Fixed the MozaiksPay generated billing and usage page contract to emit canonical `analytics_dashboard` page types through both the build-context pack hints and the replayed page schema fixtures, removing stale `dashboard` page-type drift from the generated SaaS path.
- Fixed `scripts/run-infra.ps1` to propagate the `docker compose up` exit code and print an actionable error message when Docker Desktop is not running. Previously the script silently continued on failure.
- Fixed Vite 8 dev-server startup: added `optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions.moduleTypes: { '.js': 'jsx' }` so the Rolldown pre-scan can parse first-party JSX-in-.js UI files before the transform plugin runs.

### Changed

- OSS framework telemetry now emits only structural build outcome payloads. Build satisfaction and other customer/operator feedback belongs to app/operator-owned endpoints rather than the generic `MOZAIKS_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` channel.
- Tree-sitter parser packages are now installed with the core Mozaiks package so source-backed Context Graph indexing is part of the default code-context setup.
- Public docs now describe Mozaiks as not yet published to PyPI or GitHub releases, and direct users to install from a local checkout with editable install instructions instead of a public package URL.

### Removed

- Removed the unused OSS `CollaborationPort` placeholder and default `app.state.collaboration` wiring. Hosted collaboration remains a `mozaiks-app` product capability implemented through app-owned modules and platform hooks, not a generic OSS runtime port.

## 0.1.11 - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Default OSS LLM provider is now free Google Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash / gemini-2.5-flash). Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` from aistudio.google.com and `LLM_PRIMARY_API_TYPE=google`. OpenAI remains available as an alternative via `LLM_PRIMARY_API_TYPE=openai`.
- Self-hosted SaaS apps now get deterministic entitlement dispatch: AppGenerator plans an `entitlement_dispatch` module (activate/deactivate subscription actions) whenever `config/subscriptions.yaml` declares an `assignment_store` and the mozaikspay managed pack is not selected. `ConfiguredEntitlementAdapter` reads those assignment records for all entitlement gate checks.
- `scan_generated_bundle` now validates the self-hosted entitlement dispatch contract: rejects bundles with `assignment_store` but no `entitlement_dispatch` module, and rejects any `entitlement_gate` value not declared in at least one plan's capabilities.
- Added offline SaaS acceptance gate tests and a live AppPlanAgent smoke test (with committed fixture for CI replay) that verifies `entitlement_dispatch` task planning end-to-end against gpt-4o.
- Generated deployment bundles now emit `.github/workflows/readiness.yml` alongside `deploy.yml` when workflow artifacts are requested. The readiness workflow provides an environment-staging gate separate from artifact review staging; `deployment.manifest.json` carries a `readiness_workflow` field linking to it.

### Fixed

- Removed `@stripe/stripe-js` from the OSS `web_shell` dependencies. Stripe belongs in `mozaiks-app` only; the package was unused in any source file.
- Fixed `optional_list`, `optional_str`, `optional_dict`, and nullable union fields to correctly default to `None` in generated Pydantic models when no explicit default is declared, so they are truly optional without requiring the LLM to emit them.
- Fixed generated bundle scanner to detect `api_endpoint: /api/modules/...` values in YAML pages (unquoted) alongside quoted string literals. Billing and usage page contract validation now works correctly for the canonical YAML page format.

### Changed

- Expanded the production-readiness gate so the 0.1.10 cash-to-token loop is covered by generated SaaS acceptance, subscription/token runtime, scanner, and opt-in Docker/Mongo smoke checks.
- Monetization taxonomy simplified to 5 canonical OSS routes: `free`, `subscriptions`, `usage_based`, `custom`, `hybrid`. `custom` covers all app/operator-specific money flows (ecommerce, marketplace, sponsorship, contributions, campaign funding, revenue-share, payout policy) through app-owned modules, policy hooks, managed facades, or external adapters. The old granular models (`transactional`, `marketplace`, `sponsored`, `donations`, `community_funded`) are removed.
- Capability dispatch planning is now fully app-agnostic: managed packs declare `provides_capabilities: [subscription_write_path]` in their `contract.yaml` to signal ownership of the subscription assignment write path, replacing all hardcoded MozaiksPay name checks in OSS scanner and planning logic. Any operator pack can now own this role.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Added provider-neutral billing fulfillment primitives for idempotent subscription assignment, token wallet credit/debit, durable command replay/conflict logging, and generated-app cash-to-token runtime integration.
- Added first-class subscription checkout, token status, token top-up, and depleted-balance recovery contracts to the MozaiksPay generated-app facade path while keeping provider checkout and fulfillment behind MozaiksPay/OSS billing boundaries.
- Added the generated-app MozaiksPay capability pack contract, provider API contract, billing portal facade updates, and usage/billing pages for provider-neutral SaaS subscription apps.
- Added workflow transport bridging so generated workflow capabilities can be invoked through the platform capability route contract.

### Changed

- Hardened AppGenerator route metadata, generated UI drift guards, module API template output, generated bundle scanning, and provider-neutral deployment/env manifests for future generated apps.
- Expanded Mozaiks documentation for local setup, CLI reference, self-hosting, architecture, and the 0.1.10 cash-to-token loop.

### Fixed

- Fixed generated capability env contracts so provider-specific env vars stay metadata-driven instead of being inlined into capability packs.
- Fixed generated OIDC env placeholders and billing runtime type contracts for stricter CI/runtime validation.

## 0.1.9 - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Ask-mode human-support escalation now short-circuits the LLM turn after rendering the support handoff UI, so users do not receive an extra assistant answer after requesting an operator.
- **`infra/docker/Dockerfile` no longer references removed root launcher and workspace files**: it now installs the real `mozaiks` package from `pyproject.toml` (fixing missing runtime dependencies such as `jsonschema` and `limits` that the old `requirements.txt`-based build silently dropped) and serves the first-party `factory_app/` workspace via `mozaiks serve . --host studio`. Verified with a local `docker build` + container smoke test against MongoDB.
- **Helm chart liveness probe pointed at a 404** (`infra/helm/mozaiks/values.yaml`): `livenessProbe.httpGet.path` was `/api/health/liveness`, which does not exist; the real route is `/api/health/live` (`mozaiksai/hosts/runtime.py`). Verified by rendering the chart and confirming both probe paths resolve.
- **`infra/compose/docker-compose.yml` dev `app` service used a broken removed-launcher command** with no `watchdog` dependency installed: replaced with `mozaiks serve . --host studio --reload`, plus a `PYTHONPATH=/app` override so the bind-mounted repo shadows the image's installed first-party packages for live-reload dev. Verified end to end against a real container.

### Added

- First-party Studio messaging and workspace support modules now persist support conversations through linked message threads, including profile support transcripts, app/workspace support queues, operator replies, status updates, and delete flows.
- Added the reusable `support` build-context pack for generated help-desk apps. The pack requires `messaging`, stores ticket metadata separately, and keeps support conversations in the generated `messages` module.
- **`.dockerignore`** at the repo root: none previously existed, so every `docker build` sent the full working tree (including `node_modules`, `.git`, and local caches) to the daemon; this also meant the old Dockerfile's `web_shell`/`chat-ui` copy would have unintentionally bundled `node_modules` files matched by `MANIFEST.in` glob patterns.
- **`infra-build` CI job** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): builds `infra/docker/Dockerfile`, smoke-runs the resulting image against a real MongoDB service until `/api/health` reports healthy, then lints and renders the `infra/helm/mozaiks` chart with a regression check for the corrected health probe paths.
- **Source hygiene scan wired into CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `lint` job): the existing `scripts/production_readiness_gate.py` terminology scan previously only ran through the standalone script; it now runs on every PR/push.

### Changed

- The generated `messaging` build pack is now a thread/message substrate only. Contacts, friends, follows, invitations, posts, and feeds belong to the `social` pack or to an app-specific relationship provider.
- AppGenerator now prioritizes the managed `mozaikspay` operator pack for SaaS subscriptions, billing portals, seats, credits, and usage limits when no alternate billing provider is explicitly requested.
- Hardened usage pricing catalog sync with upstream content hashing, normalized row-count drift checks, generated catalog change summaries, docs-based override guidance, and private override-file packaging protection.
- Clarified the deployment boundary between repo-local `infra/`, the first-party `factory_app/` workspace, and provider-neutral generated app deployment artifacts; added a canonical architecture doc and rewrote the stale `infra/DEPLOYMENT.md` guide to match current OSS behavior.

### Removed

- Removed obsolete first-party demo social modules from the Studio app bundle and removed contacts templates from the messaging pack. Social behavior remains available through the explicit `social` build-context pack.

## 0.1.8 - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Workspace integrations catalog** (`factory_app/app/modules/workspace_integrations/`):
  New Studio module that tracks third-party service configuration status at the workspace level. Status (`configured`, `partial`, `missing`, `unknown`) is derived server-side from environment secrets — no secret values are ever returned. Includes operator notes storage per integration, `MOZAIKS_INTEGRATIONS_REGISTRY_MODE=catalog_only` for hosted multi-tenant deployments, and 14 catalog entries across 9 categories (payments, email, sms, ai, storage, source_control, notifications, database, cache, auth, analytics). Studio workspace page at `/integrations` shows the full catalog grouped by category with per-secret presence rows. AppGenerator gains `check_workspace_integrations` tool (registered to `AppPlanAgent`) so the agent can detect available integrations early in planning and avoid prompting for credentials that are already configured.

- **Immutable audit trail** (`mozaiksai/core/audit/`):
  Every module action and workflow start is logged to a dedicated append-only MongoDB `audit_log` collection with actor, app_id, resource, action, and inputs hash. Failures degrade to structured log so records are never silently lost. Wired into `ModuleExecutor.execute()` via fire-and-forget `asyncio.create_task`.

- **Circuit breaker for AppBackendPort** (`mozaiksai/core/adapters/circuit_breaker.py`):
  `CircuitBreaker` wraps `HttpAppBackendAdapter.request()`. Opens after 5 consecutive failures (configurable via `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`), fast-fails with `backend_circuit_open` for `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT` seconds (default 30s), then probes with HALF_OPEN state. Per-service registry via `get_circuit_breaker_sync()`.

- **Distributed lock for chat state** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/persistence/distributed_lock.py`):
  `distributed_lock()` async context manager uses MongoDB `findOneAndUpdate` to prevent two runtime instances from resuming the same chat simultaneously. TTL index auto-cleans orphaned locks. Falls through silently in degraded mode (MongoDB unavailable).

- **Prometheus metrics endpoint** (`mozaiksai/core/metrics/prometheus_exporter.py`):
  `GET /metrics` in Prometheus text exposition format. Exports workflow counters, module action rates, token usage, auth failures, circuit breaker opens, and HTTP request counts. Optional Bearer token protection via `PROMETHEUS_METRICS_TOKEN`. Enable/disable via `PROMETHEUS_METRICS_ENABLED`. Router registered automatically in `hosts/runtime.py`.

- **Feature flags** (`mozaiksai/core/flags/`):
  `FeatureFlags` evaluates flags from env vars (`MOZAIKS_FLAG_{NAME}`) with optional MongoDB-backed backend for runtime toggling without redeployment. App-scoped flags supported (`is_enabled("flag", app_id=...)`). Cache TTL configurable via `FEATURE_FLAGS_CACHE_TTL`.

- **Task idempotency guard** (`mozaiksai/core/workflow/idempotency.py`):
  `IdempotencyGuard` deduplicates tool executions by `(chat_id, tool_name, args_hash)`. Prevents double-execution when a task batch retries after a successful tool call but failed result persistence. Records stored in `idempotency_records` collection with 24h TTL.

- **Artifact store port + adapters** (`mozaiksai/core/ports/artifact_store.py`):
  `ArtifactStore` protocol with `LocalArtifactStore` (default) and `S3ArtifactStore` (production). Streams large artifacts to object storage; MongoDB holds only metadata + URL. Configured via `ARTIFACT_STORE_BACKEND` env var (`local` | `s3`).

- **Inter-instance event bus** (`mozaiksai/core/ports/event_bus.py`):
  `EventBus` protocol with `NoOpEventBus` (single instance), `MongoEventBus` (change streams, no extra infra), and `RedisEventBus` (pub/sub). Configured via `EVENT_BUS_BACKEND` (`noop` | `mongo` | `redis`). Started automatically during runtime startup.

- **Artifact versioning** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/persistence/artifact_version.py`):
  `ArtifactVersion` records artifact ID, version, lineage, parent_build_id, store URL, and checksum in `artifact_versions` collection. Helpers: `record_artifact_version()`, `get_artifact_history()`, `next_version_number()`.

- **Global durable workflow queue** (`mozaiksai/core/workflow/queue.py`):
  `WorkflowQueue` protocol with `NoOpWorkflowQueue` (preserves existing per-instance semaphore) and `MongoWorkflowQueue` (atomic claim with findOneAndUpdate, global concurrency limit, priority support, TTL expiry). Configured via `WORKFLOW_QUEUE_BACKEND` (`noop` | `mongo`).

- **Redis distributed cache** (`mozaiksai/core/cache/`):
  `RedisCache` caches JWKS, app context, and module registry across instances. Falls back to in-memory `_MemoryCache` when Redis is unavailable. Named helpers: `get_jwks()`, `set_app_context()`, `invalidate_app_context()`. Connected automatically at startup.

- **AG2 isolation adapter** (`mozaiksai/core/adapters/ag2_runner.py`):
  `AG2RunnerAdapter` wraps AG2's `ConversableAgent`, `GroupChat`, and `initiate_chat` API. Isolates AG2 imports to one file so AG2 version bumps require only this adapter to change. Includes compatibility watchpoints for tracked AG2 API surfaces. `build_llm_config()` now accepts `fallback_models` kwarg for ordered fallback config_list construction.

- **LLM fallback config builder** (`mozaiksai/core/adapters/llm_fallback.py`):
  `build_fallback_config_list()` constructs an AG2-compatible `config_list` with a primary model and env-driven fallback models (via `LLM_FALLBACK_MODELS`). `get_healthy_config_list()` reorders entries so circuit-breaker-OPEN providers are deprioritised. `build_fallback_llm_config()` is a drop-in replacement for `AG2RunnerAdapter.build_llm_config()` with full fallback support. AG2 network runner binds trace context at workflow start.

- **Async trace context propagation** (`mozaiksai/core/tracing/`):
  `bind_trace_id()` sets the current trace ID on a Python `ContextVar`. Because asyncio automatically copies `ContextVar` state to child tasks, every `asyncio.create_task()` (audit logger, fire-and-forget) inherits the trace ID without parameter threading. `RequestIDMiddleware` now calls `bind_trace_id()` on each request. `trace_context()` context manager supports scoped binding with automatic restore. `TraceContext.as_log_extra()` provides structured log enrichment and `as_headers()` returns outbound HTTP trace headers.

- **Platform router decomposition — complete** (`mozaiksai/hosts/routers/`):
  Extracted all remaining route groups from `platform.py` into dedicated router modules: `chat.py`, `sessions.py`, `transitions.py`, `profile.py`, `workflows.py` (in addition to existing `notifications.py`, `shell.py`, `modules.py`). `platform.py` reduced from ~3,662 to ~2,835 lines. `resolve_scope_from_principal()` moved to `mozaiksai.core.auth.dependencies` as the canonical shared location. Two missing persistence methods (`delete_general_chat`, `fetch_general_chat_transcript`) added to `AG2PersistenceManager`. The modules router reads `executor_registry` from `request.app.state` for clean test isolation.

- **HMAC-SHA256 artifact signing** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/persistence/artifact_signer.py`):
  `sign_artifact()` and `verify_artifact()` use HMAC-SHA256 with a hex-encoded 32-byte key from `ARTIFACT_SIGNING_KEY` env var. Unsigned mode degrades gracefully (returns empty string / always verifies) when no key is configured. `assert_artifact_authentic()` raises `ArtifactSignatureError` on tamper detection. `artifact_promotion.py` now signs bundles at promotion time and includes `bundle_hmac_sha256` in refinement metadata. 16 tests added.

- **Durable refinement event tracking** (`mozaiksai/control_plane/refinement_tracking.py`):
  `record_refinement_event()` persists audit documents to `mozaiks.cp_refinement_events` collection with event kind, request ID, app ID, change class, workflow sequence, outcome, and timing. Fire-and-forget — never raises to callers. `get_refinement_history()` queries by app and optional request ID. `OrchestrationControlHarness` now emits `request_received`, `classified`, `completed`, and `failed` events at each decision boundary.

- **Keycloak realm version control** (`infra/keycloak/export.sh`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
  `export.sh` exports the current realm config from a running Keycloak instance via the admin API and writes to `factory_app/app/brand/realm-export.json`. CI lint job now validates `realm-export.json` is valid JSON with required fields (`realm=mozaiks`, `enabled`) on every push and pull request.

- **Concurrency test suite** (`tests/concurrency/`):
  12 new tests covering: circuit breaker state transitions, concurrent feature flag reads, trace ID propagation to child tasks, `trace_context()` restore, task isolation, LLM fallback config ordering, circuit-aware config_list reordering, idempotency guard dedup under concurrency.

- **Kubernetes Helm chart** (`infra/helm/mozaiks/`):
  Production-grade Helm chart with: Deployment (RollingUpdate, maxUnavailable=0), Service, Ingress, HPA (CPU + memory), PodDisruptionBudget, PVC, ServiceAccount, ConfigMap. Secret values sourced from a named Kubernetes Secret (zero secrets in chart). Pod anti-affinity preferred across nodes. Liveness and readiness probes on `/api/health/liveness` and `/api/health/readiness`. Prometheus scrape annotations on pod.

- **Grafana dashboard** (`infra/grafana/mozaiks-dashboard.json`):
  Pre-built Grafana dashboard with panels for: workflow health (started/completed/failed/active, success rate), module action rate, LLM token usage (input/output per minute, totals), auth failure rate, circuit breaker opens, HTTP request rate by status class, uptime. Configurable `DS_PROMETHEUS` datasource input.

- **Operational docs** (`docs/operations/`):
  Zero-downtime deployment runbook, secrets rotation procedure, alerting thresholds, horizontal scaling guide, backup and recovery procedures, and incident runbooks for: LLM API down, MongoDB connection exhausted, disk full, Keycloak unreachable.

- **`monitoring` optional extra** (`pyproject.toml`):
  Adds `redis[asyncio]>=5.0.0` and `boto3>=1.28.0` for Redis cache and S3 artifact store backends. Install with `pip install "mozaiks[monitoring]"`.

### Changed

- **CI/CD hardening** (`pyproject.toml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
  Added `pytest-rerunfailures>=12.0` to dev deps. Pytest now re-runs flaky tests up to 2 times on `AssertionError` or `TimeoutError`. Coverage threshold set to `--cov-fail-under=30` (calibrated to full-suite achievable level). mypy CI command updated to `--disable-error-code=import-untyped` to suppress PyYAML stub noise consistent with `pyproject.toml` config.

- **mypy clean pass** (`mozaiksai/`, `factory_app/`):
  12 targeted type fixes across `ag2_runner.py`, `artifact_store.py`, `supabase.py`, `orchestration_patterns.py`, `queue.py`, `artifact_version.py`, `http_app_backend.py`, `commerce/backend/repo.py`, `DesignDocs/tools/save_design_doc.py`, `SubscriptionContractDesigner/tools/save_subscription_contract.py`, `refinement_harness_codegen.py`, `routers/modules.py`. Result: 477 source files, 0 errors.

- **`hosts/runtime.py` startup** (`mozaiksai/hosts/runtime.py`):
  Runtime startup now ensures distributed lock indexes, idempotency indexes, and artifact version indexes, connects the Redis cache, and starts the inter-instance event bus. All operations degrade silently if their backends are unavailable.

### Fixed

- **Hosted app runtime compatibility** (`mozaiksai/refinement_harness/config.py`, `mozaiksai/core/runtime/composition/module_executor.py`, `mozaiksai/core/runtime/persistence/indexes.py`):
  Control-plane runtime config now accepts optional profile metadata used by hosted app workspaces, module output validation normalizes `nullable: true` schemas before JSON Schema validation, and database index application strips metadata-only options while supporting literal Motor collections. These fixes unblock `mozaiks-app` startup, module dispatch, and database index bootstrapping from an installed package.

### Changed

- **Frontend runtime stability** (`chat-ui/src/app/MozaiksApp.jsx`, `chat-ui/src/ui/primitives/DataTable.jsx`):
  Opted into React Router v7 future flags to remove development warnings and made DataTable default arrays stable so table consumers without explicit data do not trigger render loops.

### Security

- **Multi-tenant isolation gaps closed** (`mozaiksai/core/data/persistence/persistence_manager.py`, `mozaiksai/hosts/runtime.py`):
  Two cross-tenant isolation gaps identified and fixed:
  - Cache seed find/update queries in `persistence_manager.get_or_assign_cache_seed()` (lines ~319, ~343)
    now include `app_id` in the MongoDB filter for defense-in-depth isolation. Previously the filter
    used only `chat_id`; since chat IDs are UUIDs the practical risk was near zero but the pattern
    was inconsistent with the rest of the persistence layer.
  - `create_chat_session()` duplicate check (line ~381) now scopes the existing-document check to
    the requesting app.
  - `/api/workflows/{workflow_name}/trigger` now calls `validate_path_app_id(principal, app_id)` so
    an authenticated caller cannot create workflow sessions scoped to a foreign app by supplying an
    arbitrary `app_id` in the request body.

- **Per-user WebSocket connection limit** (`mozaiksai/core/transport/simple_transport.py`):
  Added `MOZAIKS_MAX_WS_CONNECTIONS_PER_USER` (default 20) to cap how many concurrent
  WebSocket sessions a single authenticated user can have open at once. A user opening
  more connections than this limit receives WS close code 1008. Prevents a single user
  from exhausting the global connection pool. Documented in `.env.example` alongside the
  existing `MOZAIKS_MAX_WS_CONNECTIONS` and `MOZAIKS_WS_IDLE_TIMEOUT` settings.

- **Theme endpoint path validation** (`mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py`):
  Added `validate_path_id(app_id, "app_id")` to `/api/themes/{app_id}` so malformed
  path segments (e.g., traversal sequences) are rejected before theme resolution runs,
  consistent with validation on other path-parameter endpoints.

- **WebSocket connection rate limiting** (`mozaiksai/core/transport/rate_limit.py`):
  Added `/ws/` to `_DEFAULT_PATH_LIMITS` (10/min per client) so WebSocket upgrade requests
  are governed by a tighter path-specific cap rather than the global 60/min default. Each
  WebSocket connection opens a full workflow context, making WS upgrades a high-cost target.
  Documented in the module docstring.

- **Startup checks for rate limiting and Redis** (`mozaiksai/core/startup/validation.py`):
  Added two new boot-time checks:
  - `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=false` in a production environment now emits a structured warning
    (raises `StartupConfigError` in strict mode), consistent with the `AUTH_ENABLED` check.
  - When `REDIS_URL` is configured, the runtime now TCP-pings the Redis host/port at startup
    and warns if unreachable. Without Redis, the rate limiter silently falls back to in-memory
    storage that does not enforce limits across multiple instances. The Redis check is a warning
    only even in strict mode — the in-memory fallback is functional.

- **IDOR protection on module action routes** (`mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py`):
  `_execute_module_action` now validates an explicit `?app_id` query parameter against the
  authenticated principal's token claim before dispatching. Callers cannot execute actions
  scoped to a foreign app by supplying `?app_id=other-app`. The check is a no-op when
  `AUTH_ENABLED=false`. Authorization is evaluated before executor availability checks so
  auth errors always take priority over infrastructure errors.

- **Broad HTTP 500 error detail suppression** (`mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py`, `studio.py`, `runtime.py`, `factory.py`, `core/admin/router.py`):
  Removed raw exception text from 22 additional HTTPException 500 `detail=` fields across
  platform (12), studio (7), runtime (1), factory (2), and admin router (1) endpoints.
  All exceptions are still logged server-side; callers receive only the action-level description.

- **Module executor error suppression** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/composition/module_executor.py`):
  The catch-all `EXECUTION_ERROR` handler no longer surfaces `str(exc)` in the
  `ModuleResult.error` field (and thus the HTTP response body). Exception text that could
  contain DB connection strings, internal paths, or stack details is replaced with
  `"Action '{action}' failed"`; full detail remains in `logger.error(..., exc_info=True)`.

- **Workflow bridge error suppression** (`mozaiksai/core/transport/workflow_bridge.py`):
  `handle_user_input_from_api` no longer includes raw exception text in the websocket
  `send_error` message or the HTTP return dict on `WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_FAILED`.
  Replaced with generic user-facing messages; internal details stay in `logger.error`.

- **Rate limit middleware integration tests** (`tests/test_rate_limit_middleware.py`):
  19 end-to-end integration tests added covering: 429 responses, `Retry-After` and
  `X-RateLimit-*` headers, per-path prefix limits, excluded paths, OPTIONS bypass,
  per-client bucket isolation, CORS header on 429, and disabled mode. Added
  `test_execution_error_does_not_leak_exception_message` to module executor tests.

- **Auth endpoint rate limit**: `/api/auth` now has a tighter default of 20 req/min
  (vs the global 60) in `RateLimitMiddleware` to reduce brute-force risk on token
  and login routes. Overridable via `RATE_LIMIT_PATH_LIMITS`.

- **Profile panel error sanitization** (`mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py`):
  `get_profile_panels` no longer surfaces raw exception messages from module action
  failures in the `/api/me/profile-panels` response. Replaced `str(exc)` with a
  generic `"Action {action!r} failed"` message; full detail stays in server logs.

- **SSRF mitigation on webhook_url** (`mozaiksai/hosts/runtime.py`):
  `TriggerWorkflowRequest.webhook_url` validated with a Pydantic `field_validator`:
  must use `https://`, include a hostname, and must not target private or reserved
  IP space. Blocked ranges: loopback (`127.x` / `::1` / `localhost`), all RFC-1918
  private ranges (`10.x`, `172.16–31.x`, `192.168.x`), link-local / cloud metadata
  (`169.254.x`), IPv6 ULA (`fc00::/7`), and all `ipaddress.ip_address` reserved and
  multicast ranges. 9 new validator tests cover all blocked ranges.

- **Agent tool error message suppression** (`mozaiksai/core/events/auto_tool_handler.py`, `mozaiksai/core/workflow/app_backend_tools.py`, `mozaiksai/core/adapters/http_app_backend.py`):
  Auto-tool failures, backend request errors, emit-event failures, and health-check
  exceptions no longer include raw Python exception text in tool result payloads that
  AG2 agents reason over (and could surface in chat messages). Replaced with opaque
  error codes; full exception details remain in `logger.error`.

- **WebSocket path parameter validation** (`mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py`):
  `/ws/{workflow_name}/{app_id}/{chat_id}/{user_id}` now validates all four path
  parameters against `validate_path_id` before authentication. Invalid values
  (path traversal, shell metacharacters, values >128 chars) close the WebSocket
  with code 1008 (Policy Violation) before any DB or auth operations run.

- **Path parameter validation on platform routes** (`mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py`):
  `validate_path_id` now applied across all platform routes that take path parameters.
  Covers `notification_id`, `workflow_name`, `chat_id`, `general_chat_id`, and `app_id`
  on chat, session, general-chat, notification, and upload endpoints. Rejects path
  traversal, shell metacharacters, and values over 128 characters before they reach
  MongoDB queries or downstream handlers.

- **Health check error detail suppression** (`mozaiksai/hosts/runtime.py`, `mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py`):
  `/api/health/ready` MongoDB ping errors no longer include raw exception text in
  `checks.mongodb`; returns opaque `"error"` code instead. `/api/health` MongoDB
  unreachable detail no longer includes `str(exc)`. Journey binding failures in
  `/api/chats/.../start` no longer expose internal error text in the 400 response.
  `startup_degraded_reason` (surfaced in health responses) now stores only the
  exception class name rather than the full message, preventing DB connection
  strings and internal paths from leaking via unauthenticated health endpoints.

- **Module executor TypeError suppression** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/composition/module_executor.py`):
  `INVALID_PARAMS` error responses no longer include the raw `TypeError` message,
  which could expose handler parameter names or internal type details. Returns
  `"Invalid parameters for action '{action}'"` instead; full detail stays in logs.

- **Path parameter validation on all Studio routes** (`mozaiksai/hosts/studio.py`):
  `validate_path_id` now applied to all Studio route path parameters:
  `artifact_version_id` on bundle/review/accept/reject/promote endpoints,
  `service` on integration connector endpoints, and `app_id` on app-context
  management endpoints. Rejects malformed identifiers before any artifact store,
  workspace, or context operations run.

- **Path ID validation on workflow routes** (`mozaiksai/hosts/runtime.py`):
  `validate_path_id` now applied to `workflow_name`, `app_id`, and `chat_id` on
  five previously unprotected routes: `component_action`, `trigger`, `transport`,
  `tools`, and `ui-tools`.

- **HTTP security headers middleware** (`mozaiksai/core/transport/security_headers.py`):
  `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` now added to all Mozaiks hosts. Sets
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
  `Content-Security-Policy` (with `frame-ancestors 'none'`),
  `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and HSTS on HTTPS connections.
  All values are env-configurable. Existing route-level headers are preserved.

- **Path parameter sanitization** (`mozaiksai/core/auth/dependencies.py`):
  `validate_path_id()` added and wired into chat, WebSocket, and user input
  endpoints. Rejects path traversal (`..`), shell metacharacters, spaces,
  and values over 128 characters before they reach MongoDB queries.

- **Fixed wildcard CORS + credentials** (`mozaiksai/factory.py`):
  `create_mozaiks_app()` no longer adds CORS middleware with `"*"` origin
  and `allow_credentials=True` (invalid per spec; browsers reject it).
  CORS middleware is now only added when explicit non-wildcard origins are provided.

- **Tightened CORS method/header wildcards** (`mozaiksai/hosts/runtime.py`):
  `allow_methods` and `allow_headers` replaced with explicit allowlists.
  `expose_headers` now declares the rate-limit and request-ID headers the
  frontend needs.

- **Request body size limit** (`mozaiksai/core/transport/request_middleware.py`):
  `RequestBodySizeLimitMiddleware` rejects JSON requests with a
  `Content-Length` header exceeding `MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES` (default 1 MB)
  before the route handler reads the body. Upload paths are excluded by
  default and configurable via `MAX_REQUEST_BODY_EXCLUDED_PATHS`.

- **Request ID propagation** (`mozaiksai/core/transport/request_middleware.py`):
  `RequestIDMiddleware` attaches a unique `X-Request-ID` to every request
  and response. Client-supplied IDs are validated and echoed; otherwise a
  UUID4 is generated. Bound to `request.state.request_id` for handlers,
  tools, and structured logs.

- **MIME type enforcement on file uploads** (`mozaiksai/core/chat_attachments/attachments.py`):
  `handle_chat_upload` now validates the declared `content_type` against a configurable
  MIME type allowlist before writing any bytes to disk. Default allowlist covers text,
  image, PDF, JSON, and XML types. Configurable via `UPLOAD_ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES`
  (comma-separated; set to `*` to disable). Content-type parameters (e.g.
  `; charset=utf-8`) are stripped before comparison. 4 integration tests added.

- **Upload path containment** (`mozaiksai/core/chat_attachments/attachments.py`):
  `handle_chat_upload` now verifies that `dest_dir` and `stored_path` remain inside
  `upload_root` after `Path.resolve()`. Defense-in-depth against symlink-based or
  unusual `app_id`/`chat_id` path traversal edge cases.

- **Chat upload form field validation** (`mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py`):
  `_handle_chat_upload` now calls `validate_path_id` on `app_id` and `chat_id` from
  form data, ensuring both `/api/chat/upload` and `/api/chat/upload/{app_id}/{user_id}`
  reject malformed identifiers before filesystem operations run.

- **Sandbox API error detail suppression** (`factory_app/workflows/AppGenerator/tools/sandbox_api.py`):
  All sandbox HTTP routes (create, sync, start, status, stop) and the WebSocket
  endpoint no longer include raw exception text in 500/503 responses or WebSocket
  close reasons. Generic messages returned; full exceptions logged server-side.

- **Studio refinement endpoint error detail suppression** (`mozaiksai/hosts/studio.py`):
  Refinement classification (503) and coding worker (503) exception handlers no
  longer include `str(exc)` in the HTTP response detail. Generic messages returned;
  full exceptions logged with `exc_info=True`.

- **Health endpoint module name suppression** (`mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py`):
  `startup_degraded_reason` for partial module load failures no longer includes the
  list of failed module names, which would expose internal app structure to
  unauthenticated callers of `/health`. Returns only the count; full name list
  remains in `logger.error`.

- **AppGenerator admin route template hardened** (`factory_app/workflows/AppGenerator/tools/app_backend_admin_codegen.py`):
  The generated `/api/admin/config` route template was emitting `str(exc)` in the
  HTTP 500 detail, which would have leaked exceptions in all generated apps' admin
  endpoints. Replaced with a generic message; full exception is logged server-side.

- **Module handler symlink-escape guard** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/app/module_loader.py`):
  After locating a handler file, the loader now calls `handler_path.resolve().relative_to(module_dir.resolve())`
  to confirm the resolved path is still within the module directory. This guards against
  symlink-based escapes that the existing static analysis (rejecting `..`, absolute paths,
  and `_shared` references) cannot prevent. A symlinked handler pointing outside the
  module directory causes a `ModuleLoadError` and the module is classified as failed.

- **Azure Key Vault connector error suppression** (`mozaiksai/core/secrets/connector_vault.py`):
  `store_secret`, `get_secret`, and `delete_secret` no longer return raw Azure
  SDK exception text (which can include subscription IDs and vault URLs).
  Generic messages returned to callers; exceptions logged with `exc_info=True`.

- **AG2 stream history bounded** (`mozaiksai/core/adapters/ag2_stream_storage.py`):
  `get_history` now applies `.limit(10_000)` to prevent unbounded MongoDB reads
  on event streams from long-running or abnormally large AG2 tasks.

- **SSRF guard on domain probe** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/infra_assurance/backend/service.py`):
  `run_checks` now validates the caller-supplied domain through `_is_safe_probe_domain()`
  before any HTTP probe runs. Blocked targets: loopback names (`localhost`, `127.x`,
  `::1`), all RFC-1918 private ranges, link-local/IMDS (`169.254.x`), CGNAT
  (`100.64.0.0/10`), IPv6 ULA (`fc00::/7`), and private DNS TLDs
  (`.local`, `.internal`, `.corp`, `.home`, `.lan`, `.intranet`, `.localdomain`,
  `.example`, `.test`, `.invalid`). Domains that fail validation return an error
  without making any outbound request. Hostname-format validation applied to bare
  labels. 6 new tests cover accepted public hosts, all blocked categories, and edge cases.

- **HTTP probe error sanitization** (`mozaiks-app/app/services/adapters/probes/http_health.py`):
  `check_http_health` no longer includes raw `httpx` exception text in the returned
  `error` field (which flows through `infra_assurance` and `provider_connections`
  into user-visible responses). `TimeoutException` returns `"timeout after {N}s"`;
  `HTTPError` returns only the exception class name. Full detail logged server-side.

- **Azure cert 404 detection hardened** (`mozaiks-app/app/services/adapters/ssl/azure_cert.py`):
  `get_status` and `deprovision` previously parsed `"404"` and `"NotFound"` from
  `str(exc)`, which is brittle and could match false positives in exception messages.
  Both now check `exc.response.status_code == 404` directly on the response attribute.

- **Auth bypass fixed in build event route** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/app_registry/backend/routes_build_events.py`):
  `_authorize_internal_request` previously allowed unauthenticated calls in any
  environment where `MOZAIKS_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_API_KEY` was not configured. Flipped
  to fail-safe: an unconfigured key now returns 503 (endpoint not configured) rather
  than silently passing the request. Removed dead `_production_env()` helper.

- **Admin-only service guards for app_registry** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/app_registry/backend/service.py`, `policy.py`):
  `list_all_apps` now calls `require_app_registry_admin(ctx)` at the service layer,
  enforcing that the caller holds `app_registry.admin` permission. Previously the
  guard existed only in `module.yaml`; a misconfigured host or direct service call
  could bypass it. `require_app_registry_admin` added to `policy.py`.

- **Unsafe hosting URL scheme rejected** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/app_registry/backend/service.py`):
  `on_app_deployed` now validates that `hosting_url` uses `https://` before storing it.
  Non-HTTPS URLs (including `javascript:`, `file://`, and bare HTTP) are rejected with an
  error; the call is logged and the record is not updated.

- **Bare assert replaced with explicit guard** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/app_registry/backend/generated_bundle_gate.py`):
  `validate_generated_bundle_for_hosting` contained `assert bundle_path is not None`
  which is silently removed by Python's `-O` flag in optimized production builds.
  Replaced with an explicit `if bundle_path is None: return _failure(...)` check.

- **IDOR fix for listing submission** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/investor_marketplace/backend/service.py`):
  `submit_listing` now fetches the target listing and verifies `owner_id` matches the
  authenticated user before performing any update. Previously a caller could supply an
  arbitrary `listing_id` and mutate another user's listing record.

- **Anonymous investor fallback removed** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/investor_marketplace/backend/policy.py`):
  `investor_id_from_context` previously returned the string `"anonymous"` when no
  `user_id` was present. Unauthenticated callers could create records aggregated under
  a single shared `"anonymous"` key. Now returns `""`, and all write methods in the
  service layer reject an empty `investor_id` with an explicit auth-required error.

- **Admin-only service guards for investor_marketplace** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/investor_marketplace/backend/service.py`, `policy.py`):
  `approve_listing`, `approve_marketplace_placement`, and
  `bulk_set_marketplace_placement_status` now call `require_marketplace_admin(ctx)` at
  the service layer, enforcing the `marketplace.approve` permission even when reached
  through non-module-dispatch paths. `require_marketplace_admin` added to `policy.py`.

- **Input length limits and investor_type allowlist** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/investor_marketplace/backend/service.py`):
  `record_investment_interest` truncates `message` to 2,000 characters.
  `upsert_investor_profile` validates `investor_type` against an explicit allowlist
  (`individual`, `institutional`, `fund`, `firm`, `angel`, `corporate`, `family_office`,
  `vc`, `pe`) and truncates `thesis` to 2,000 characters.
  `record_placement_impression` and `record_placement_click` truncate `slot` and
  `source` to 64 characters. Prevents unbounded data from being written to MongoDB.

- **Open-redirect guard on hosting_url in mark_deployed** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/hosting/backend/service.py`):
  `mark_deployed` now validates `hosting_url` uses `https://` before storing it or emitting
  the `hosted.hosting.app.deployed` event. Non-https URLs are rejected with success=False.
  2 new tests cover http:// and bare-hostname rejection.

- **Input length limits on community_membership, mozaikspay_checkout, domain_registry**:
  - `community_membership.create_community`: name truncated to 100 chars, description to 1,000 chars.
  - `mozaikspay_checkout.create_checkout_session`: description truncated to 500 chars.
  - `domain_registry.record_certificate_observation`: certificate_source truncated to 50 chars,
    certificate_provider to 100 chars, certificate_issuer to 200 chars.

- **Open-redirect guard in mozaikspay billing_portal template** (`factory_app/build_context/mozaikspay/templates/modules/billing_portal/backend/service.py`):
  `open_billing_portal` now validates `return_url` before passing it to the MozaiksPay client.
  Empty URLs return `INVALID_INPUT`; non-`https://` schemes (including `http://`, `javascript:`,
  and bare paths) are rejected without contacting the billing API. The fix applies to the
  generator template, so all apps generated with the mozaikspay capability pack get the guard
  automatically. Defense-in-depth alongside any MozaiksPay server-side validation.

- **Open-redirect guard on billing portal return_url** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/hosted_billing/backend/service.py`):
  `create_billing_portal_session` now validates that `return_url` uses the `https://`
  scheme and contains a non-empty host before passing the URL to the payment provider Customer
  Portal API. `http://` and `javascript:` URLs are rejected with `INVALID_INPUT`
  without contacting payment provider. 3 new tests cover http rejection, javascript: rejection,
  and empty URL. payment provider itself also validates portal return URLs in the dashboard
  allowlist, so this is defense-in-depth on the Mozaiks side.

- **Public-status filter bypass closed** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/investor_marketplace/backend/service.py`, `policy.py`):
  `list_listings` and `list_marketplace_placements` now enforce status filters for
  non-admin callers: non-admins always receive `{"$in": ["live", "approved"]}` (or
  `"live"` for placements) regardless of the `status` parameter supplied. Previously
  a caller could pass `status=draft` to bypass the live/approved default and read
  unpublished listings. Admins with `marketplace.approve` may still supply any
  valid status. `is_marketplace_admin` helper added to `policy.py`.

- **target_result sanitization in remediation_registry** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/remediation_registry/backend/service.py`):
  The failure path of `approve_and_execute` was returning the raw dispatcher result
  dict as `target_result`, which could contain `error`, `message`, and `status` fields
  from module action handlers. Now uses the same `_summarize_target_result()` helper
  as the success path, returning only safe structural fields (`success`, `record_id`,
  `record_type`, `name`, `provider`).

- **Startup check for auth provider misconfiguration** (`mozaiksai/core/startup/validation.py`):
  When `ENV=production`, auth is not explicitly disabled (`AUTH_ENABLED` not false), and
  none of the provider env vars (`SUPABASE_URL`, `KEYCLOAK_URL`+`KEYCLOAK_REALM`,
  `AUTH_JWKS_URL`+`AUTH_ISSUER`, or `AUTH_PROVIDER`) are set, the runtime previously
  silently fell back to demo mode (no authentication). A new boot-time check now emits
  a structured warning for this gap; in strict mode (`MOZAIKS_STARTUP_CHECKS=strict`) it
  raises `StartupConfigError`. 8 new tests cover all provider detection branches and the
  strict-mode raise path.

- **Defense-in-depth admin guards for dns_management and schema_migrations** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/dns_management/backend/service.py`, `mozaiks-app/app/modules/schema_migrations/backend/policy.py`, `service.py`):
  - `dns_management.provision_activation_record` is an event-authorized internal action
    (`api_surface: internal, permissions: []`) called by the event bus, but had no
    service-layer guard. Added `require_ops_admin(ctx)` — the `ModuleContext` pass-through
    allows event-driven calls through while blocking direct non-admin API calls.
    Updated `test_all_actions_require_ops_admin` to exempt `api_surface: internal` actions
    (event-authorized actions use a different security model).
  - `schema_migrations.record_migration` and `run_migration` declared `schema_migrations.admin`
    in `module.yaml` but had no service-layer check. Added `require_schema_migrations_admin(ctx)`
    to `policy.py` (same `ModuleContext` pass-through pattern). 4 new tests cover
    admin allowed, `ops.admin` allowed, and non-admin rejected for both write methods.

- **Defense-in-depth admin guards for wallet admin_internal actions** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/wallet/backend/service.py`, `policy.py`):
  `get_platform_financials`, `provision_hosted_wallet`, and `get_hosted_wallet_provisioning_status`
  are `api_surface: admin_internal, permissions: [wallet.admin]` actions that previously relied
  solely on the module executor for enforcement. Added `require_wallet_admin(ctx)` to `policy.py`
  (same `ModuleContext` pass-through pattern) and wired it into all three methods. 3 new tests
  cover non-admin blocked and admin allowed for each method.

- **Input length limits on community_governance and messages write methods** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/community_governance/backend/service.py`, `mozaiks-app/app/modules/messages/backend/service.py`):
  `create_proposal` now truncates `title` to 200 characters and `description` to 5,000 characters.
  `create_announcement` now truncates `title` to 200 characters and `body` to 5,000 characters.
  Prevents unbounded user-supplied strings from being written to MongoDB. 5 new tests cover
  truncation behavior for both methods.

- **Admin-only service guard for tenant_identity list_all_tenants** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/tenant_identity/backend/service.py`):
  `list_all_tenants` had no authorization check at the service layer — any code path
  that bypassed the module executor (reaction handlers, direct instantiation, tests)
  could enumerate all tenants. Added `is_admin_context(ctx)` guard that mirrors the
  `tenant_identity.admin` permission declared in `module.yaml`. 3 new tests cover
  admin allowed, non-admin rejected, and no-permissions rejected.

- **Admin-only guards for build_intelligence, health, and hosted_billing** (`mozaiks-app`):
  - `build_intelligence`: `get_domain_patterns`, `list_all_builds`, and `get_intelligence_summary` had no
    service-layer permission check. These return unscoped build data across all users. Added
    `require_build_intelligence_admin(ctx)` to `policy.py` and wired it into all three methods. 4 new tests.
  - `health`: `get_app_health_summary` had `api_surface: admin_internal` and `permissions: [ops.admin]`
    in `module.yaml` but no service-layer guard. Created `backend/policy.py` with `require_ops_admin(ctx)`
    and wired it in. 1 new test.
  - `hosted_billing`: All 19 `admin_internal` actions relied on a stub `is_admin_context()` that
    unconditionally returned `True`. Replaced with `require_billing_admin(ctx)` (same `ModuleContext`
    pass-through pattern). Wired into all 19 service methods. Updated 10 affected test files.

- **Defense-in-depth admin guards for hosting admin_internal actions** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/hosting/backend/service.py`, `policy.py`, `routes_webhooks.py`):
  `list_requests`, `approve_request`, `get_hosting_summary`, `get_domain_pipeline_status`,
  and `record_build_result_callback` are `api_surface: admin_internal` actions with
  `permissions: [hosting.admin]` declared in `module.yaml`. Previously enforcement relied
  solely on the module executor. Added `require_hosting_admin(ctx)` to `policy.py`
  (same `ModuleContext` pass-through pattern as other modules) and wired it into all five
  methods. The webhook route `_WebhookCtx` carries `permissions = ["hosting.admin"]` after
  HMAC authentication passes, so the webhook path is not blocked by the service guard.
  Updated all affected test contexts to supply the required permission.

- **INTERNAL_API_KEY minimum-length check in startup validation** (`mozaiksai/core/startup/validation.py`):
  Added a warning when `INTERNAL_API_KEY` is set but shorter than 32 characters. The
  previous check only detected the key being absent; a short key offers insufficient entropy
  as a defense-in-depth secret. Minimum length is 32 characters. Not a hard failure in
  either mode — the key is a defense-in-depth layer, not the only auth gate.
  Tests updated to use adequately long keys; added `test_warns_when_internal_api_key_too_short`.

- **$where/$expr blocked in agent-generated MongoDB queries** (`mozaiksai/core/data/persistence/db_manager.py`):
  `load_from_database`, the agent tool for MongoDB reads, passed agent-generated query dicts
  directly to MongoDB without sanitization. Operators `$where` (arbitrary JavaScript execution)
  and `$expr` (server-side expression evaluation) are now stripped before the query reaches
  MongoDB. Value-level comparison operators (`$gte`, `$lt`, `$in`, `$regex`) inside field
  filter dicts are legitimate and are not affected. Logged as `AGENT_QUERY_BLOCKED_OPERATORS`
  for observability. 6 tests cover safe queries, value-operator pass-through, and blocking
  of both forbidden operators individually and combined.

- **context_variables size limits on workflow launch** (`mozaiksai/core/session/launcher.py`):
  `validate_context_for_workflow` accepted unbounded context dicts: no limit on the number
  of keys or the size of string values. Large payloads would be stored in MongoDB per session.
  Added: max 50 keys (`_CONTEXT_MAX_KEYS`); string values exceeding 64 KB per entry
  (`_CONTEXT_MAX_VALUE_BYTES`) are silently dropped with a structured warning log.
  Non-string values (dicts, lists, etc.) are not bounded by the byte check and pass through
  unchanged. 3 boundary tests cover: key cap, oversized value drop, and exact-limit acceptance.

- **PermissionError from service-layer guards now maps to HTTP 403** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/composition/module_executor.py`):
  Added a specific `except PermissionError` handler before the generic `except Exception`
  handler in `ModuleExecutor.execute()`. Previously, `PermissionError` raised by service-layer
  `require_X_admin(ctx)` guards was caught by the generic handler and returned with
  `error_code="EXECUTION_ERROR"`, which the platform host maps to HTTP 500. The correct
  status is 403; the platform host already routes `PERMISSION_DENIED` → 403.
  Added `test_permission_error_from_service_layer_returns_permission_denied` to ensure this
  routing holds regardless of the executor's generic catch-all order.

- **Defense-in-depth admin guards for investor_marketplace placement management** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/investor_marketplace/backend/service.py`, `policy.py`):
  Nine placement-management methods (`get_placement_performance_summary`, `list_placement_performance`,
  `get_marketplace_revenue_summary`, `list_marketplace_rail_monetization`,
  `list_marketplace_sponsor_cohorts`, `upsert_marketplace_placement`,
  `schedule_marketplace_placement`, `list_marketplace_placement_audit_trail`,
  `set_marketplace_placement_status`) previously had no service-layer permission check and relied
  solely on module executor enforcement. Added `require_marketplace_admin(ctx)` as the first call
  in each method. Added ModuleContext pass-through to `require_marketplace_admin` in `policy.py`.
  Added `test_admin_actions_require_marketplace_approve` covering all nine methods.

- **Defense-in-depth admin guard for messages.create_announcement** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/messages/backend/service.py`, `policy.py`):
  `create_announcement` is an `admin_internal` action with `permissions: [messages.admin]`
  declared in `module.yaml` but had no service-layer enforcement. Added `require_messages_admin(ctx)`
  to `policy.py` (same ModuleContext pass-through pattern) and wired it into `create_announcement`.
  Updated 3 announcement tests to supply the required permission in context.

- **Service-layer admin guards completed for app_registry, schema_migrations, tenant_identity** (`mozaiks-app`):
  - `app_registry.register_brownfield_app` and `get_registry_summary` now call `require_app_registry_admin(ctx)`.
    Added ModuleContext pass-through and `ops.admin` fallback to `require_app_registry_admin` in `policy.py`.
  - `schema_migrations.get_schema_version` and `list_migrations` now call `require_schema_migrations_admin(ctx)`.
    2 new tests cover non-admin rejection for each read method.
  - `tenant_identity.list_all_tenants` guard upgraded from soft return-error pattern to
    `require_tenant_identity_admin(ctx)` which raises `PermissionError`. 2 test assertions updated.

- **ModuleContext pass-through added to community_revenue_participation policy** (`mozaiks-app/app/modules/community_revenue_participation/backend/policy.py`):
  `require_revenue_admin` and `require_revenue_read` were missing the
  `if permissions is None and type(ctx).__name__ == "ModuleContext": return` pass-through,
  which would block event-driven internal calls despite no active callers relying on it.
  Aligned with the defensive standard applied to all other `require_X` guards in the codebase.

### Fixed

- **Bare assert replaced with explicit RuntimeError in MongoDB guards** (`mozaiksai/`):
  Eight bare `assert client is not None` / `assert config is not None` statements across
  `persistence_manager.py`, `theme_manager.py`, `entitlements.py`, `session/persistence.py`,
  `app_code_versions.py`, `workflow_artifacts.py`, and `platform.py` were silently removed
  when Python runs with the `-O` flag, causing downstream `AttributeError: 'NoneType' ...`
  instead of a clear error. Replaced with `if ... is None: raise RuntimeError(...)`.

- **AG2 stream events TTL index** (`mozaiksai/core/adapters/ag2_stream_storage.py`):
  `_ensure_indexes` now creates a TTL index on `created_at` for the AG2 stream events
  collection, capped at 30 days by default. Without this index, every workflow run's
  stream events accumulated indefinitely in MongoDB. Configurable via
  `AG2_STREAM_EVENT_TTL_DAYS` (set to 0 to disable). Documented in `.env.example`.
  2 new tests verify TTL creation and disabled mode.

### Added

- **App runtime load acceptance gate** (`factory_app/workflows/AppGenerator/tools/app_validation.py`):
  `run_app_bundle_acceptance_gate` now runs `AppLoader.load()` on the assembled bundle
  inside a temp dir before export. Regular `__init__.py` stubs are injected so all
  Python package directories resolve as regular (not namespace) packages. `sys.path` and
  `sys.modules` are snapshot-restored after each load so the gate is fully test-isolated.
  Test `test_mozaikspay_replay_uses_templates_and_passes_runtime_acceptance` now asserts
  `app_runtime_load_result["passed"] is True`.

- **Platform hooks permission override** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/composition/platform_hooks.py`):
  `PlatformHookRegistry.call_module_permissions()` allows hosted products to inject
  custom permission logic per module/action dispatch. Wired into `_execute_module_action`
  in `platform.py`; falls back to `principal.scopes` when no hook is registered.

- **`revenue_model` context variable and structured output field** for AppGenerator:
  InterviewAgent and AppPlanAgent can now capture and use the revenue model
  (`free`, `subscriptions`, `pay_per_use`, `one_time_purchase`, `community_funded`)
  to drive which billing surfaces, plan catalog artifacts, and entitlement gates
  are required in the build plan.

- **Module action timeout enforcement** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/composition/module_executor.py`):
  Async module actions are now bounded by `MODULE_ACTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 30 s).
  Actions that exceed the timeout are cancelled and return `ACTION_TIMEOUT` to the caller
  without leaving the handler coroutine alive. Set to 0 to disable. 3 new tests cover
  timeout, fast-completion, and disabled cases.

- **Module action payload size limits** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/composition/module_executor.py`):
  `ModuleExecutor.execute()` now enforces byte-size caps on both request params
  (default 512 KB, configurable via `MODULE_PARAMS_MAX_BYTES`) and action responses
  (default 2 MB, configurable via `MODULE_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES`). Oversized params are
  rejected before dispatch with `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`; oversized responses are replaced
  with a `RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE` error result. 4 new tests cover both paths and edge cases.

- **WebSocket rate limiting** (`mozaiksai/core/transport/rate_limit.py`):
  `RateLimitMiddleware` now overrides `__call__` to intercept WebSocket upgrade
  requests (`scope["type"] == "websocket"`). WS connections from clients that have
  exhausted their bucket are closed with ASGI code 1008 (Policy Violation) before
  the handshake completes. Excluded paths and disabled mode are respected.
  3 new tests cover: within-limit accept, post-exhaustion reject, and disabled pass-through.

- **Structured auth failure log fields** (`mozaiksai/core/auth/dependencies.py`, `websocket_auth.py`):
  Auth failure log records now include structured `extra` fields (`event`, `provider`,
  `status`) in addition to the formatted message, making log aggregation and alerting
  on `AUTH_FAILED` events reliable. Both HTTP and WebSocket auth failures are covered.

- **Startup validation: AUTH_ENABLED=false warning in production** (`mozaiksai/core/startup/validation.py`):
  `run_startup_checks` now warns (and raises in strict mode) when `ENV=production`
  and `AUTH_ENABLED=false`. Development and test environments are unaffected.
  5 new tests cover the warn/strict/dev/unset combinations.

- **Startup validation: upload storage writability check** (`mozaiksai/core/startup/validation.py`):
  `run_startup_checks` now emits a WARNING when `UPLOAD_STORAGE_DIR` points to an
  existing directory that is not writable. Non-existent directories are skipped
  (created on first upload). 3 new tests added to `test_startup_validation.py`.

- **Upload path containment tests** (`tests/test_chat_attachments_helpers.py`):
  3 new integration tests verify that `handle_chat_upload` rejects path traversal
  sequences in `app_id` and `chat_id` (both raise `ValueError: outside the permitted
  upload directory`) and that legitimate uploads store files inside `upload_root`.

- **Expanded production readiness gate** (`scripts/production_readiness_gate.py`):
  9 additional test suites added to `PYTEST_GATE_TARGETS` covering runtime contracts,
  platform hooks, offline acceptance, security hardening, workflow contracts, session
  launcher, and factory workflow integration.

- **Health probe and attachment tests in production gate** (`scripts/production_readiness_gate.py`):
  `test_runtime_health.py` and `test_chat_attachments_helpers.py` added to both
  `PYTEST_GATE_TARGETS` and `QUICK_PYTEST_TARGETS`. These cover the `/api/health`
  and `/api/health/ready` security contracts and the upload path-containment
  defense-in-depth layer.

- **Live AppGenerator subscription smoke** (`scripts/smoke_appgenerator_live_subscription.py`)
  now exercises real ConfigMiddlewareAgent LLM calls for SaaS subscription config
  and entitlement-gated module contract generation, then validates wiring,
  acceptance gates, export readiness, strict structured-output conformance, and
  runtime module loading.

- **Live AgentGenerator pack smoke** (`scripts/smoke_agentgenerator_live_pack.py`)
  now emits machine-readable JSON on stdout while still exercising real AG2 task
  batch generation, workflow export, semantic drift checks, and runtime loader
  promotion.

- **Structured managed-capability connector requirements** for AppGenerator capability
  packs. `capability_packs[].required_integrations` now uses a typed connector
  object with explicit public and secret fields, and managed capability defaults flow
  into IntegrationReadinessAgent without losing provider metadata.

- **OSS build telemetry** (`mozaiksai/core/telemetry.py`) — opt-in HMAC-SHA256
  signed, anonymized build telemetry. `build_registry_id` is one-way SHA-256 hashed
  before transmission. Controlled by `MOZAIKS_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`,
  `MOZAIKS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`, and `MOZAIKS_TELEMETRY_SECRET` env vars. The
  `emit_build_completed` and `emit_build_failed` lifecycle tools fire-and-forget
  telemetry payloads; `record_build_satisfaction` includes the user rating. No-op
  when `MOZAIKS_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` is unset.

- **`BuildSatisfactionRating` transition screen** — `user_choice_context` transition
  added as the final step of the `build` workflow sequence. Presents a 1–5 star rating
  UI after `app_review`; fire-and-forget POSTs to `build_intelligence.record_build_satisfaction`.
  Both `rated` and `skip` options route to `workflow_complete`.

- **Module cooccurrence pattern recording** (`tools/platform/module_pattern_recorder.py`)
  — AppGenerator `on_complete` lifecycle tool that extracts generated module IDs from
  the assembled bundle and POSTs to `build_intelligence.record_module_cooccurrence`.
  Pairwise cooccurrence patterns accumulate into a ranked module popularity index.
  Capped at 20 modules (190 pairs maximum); no-op in OSS runs.

- **WebSocket error detail suppression** (`mozaiksai/core/workflow/orchestration_patterns.py`):
  Uncaught orchestration exceptions previously sent `str(e)` in both the `error` and `message`
  fields of WebSocket `error` and `run_complete` UI events. Raw exception text can contain DB
  connection strings, internal paths, or third-party API error details visible to the browser.
  Replaced with opaque `"An internal error occurred."` / `"internal_error"` strings. Full
  exception detail continues to be logged server-side via `logger.error(..., exc_info=True)`.

- **Studio ValueError HTTP response suppression** (`mozaiksai/hosts/studio.py`):
  Eight endpoints that caught `ValueError` from internal helpers were returning `detail=str(exc)`,
  exposing artifact version IDs, internal state names, file paths, or config key names in 400/409
  responses. All eight now log the exception at WARNING level and return safe static messages
  (`"Invalid app parameters."`, `"Invalid workspace snapshot parameters."`, etc.). Context and
  full exception text remain in server logs.

- **Sandbox validation command safety check applied to all strategies** (`factory_app/workflows/AppGenerator/tools/app_validation.py`):
  `_is_safe_build_command` was only wired into the `local` strategy path. The `e2b` and `docker`
  sandbox paths passed AI-agent-generated commands directly to `adapter.run_command` which executes
  via `sh -c`. An injected command containing `;`, `&&`, or `$(...)` could achieve RCE inside the
  sandbox container. Guard now applied in `_run_sandbox_validation` before every `adapter.run_command`
  call, mirroring the local path. Unsafe commands are skipped with a warning entry (same behavior).

- **Sandbox adapter acquisition error suppression** (`factory_app/workflows/AppGenerator/tools/app_validation.py`):
  `_run_sandbox_validation` returned `errors=[str(exc)]` when adapter acquisition failed, which could
  include Docker daemon errors, network details, or E2B internal messages that then propagated into
  Studio workflow context. Replaced with `"Validation infrastructure unavailable."` and logged with
  `exc_info=True`. Added `import logging` / module-level `logger` which the file previously lacked.

- **Docker sandbox env key validation** (`mozaiksai/core/adapters/docker_sandbox.py`):
  `run_command` passed caller-supplied `envs` dict keys to `-e key=val` in `docker exec` args without
  validation. Keys that contain spaces, `=`, or other special characters could break the Docker arg
  vector in unexpected ways. Keys are now validated against `[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*` (case-insensitive)
  before inclusion; invalid keys are logged and skipped.

- **AG2 adapter RunResult error detail suppression** (`mozaiksai/core/adapters/ag2_orchestration.py`, `ag2_network_runner.py`, `ag2_task_batch_runner.py`):
  All three AG2 runner adapters returned `RunResult(error=str(exc))` on failure, which flows
  through `runner_result.error` → `run_error` in `orchestration_patterns.py` and is included in
  the `run_complete` WebSocket event sent to the browser. Raw Python exception text (which can
  contain AG2 internals, stack hints, or third-party API details) is now replaced with
  `"internal_error"`. Full exception detail is logged server-side with `exc_info=True`.

- **PermissionError message suppressed in module responses** (`mozaiksai/core/runtime/composition/module_executor.py`):
  `PermissionError` caught by the module executor was returning `str(exc)` in `ModuleResult.error`,
  which could expose internal permission set names or access control details to API callers.
  Now returns `"Permission denied."` — a generic, non-leaky string. Full detail remains in
  `logger.warning` server-side. Test updated to verify the generic message.

- **`assert` → explicit raise in theme_validation** (`mozaiksai/core/data/themes/theme_validation.py`):
  `summarize_validation` used `assert theme is not None` as a type-narrowing guard.
  Under Python `-O` (optimize), bare `assert` statements are silently removed, so a broken
  `ThemeValidationResult` would propagate `None` and raise an `AttributeError` rather than a
  clear error. Replaced with `if theme is None: raise ThemeValidationError(...)`.

- **`list_plans` action added to billing_portal template** (`factory_app/build_context/mozaikspay/templates/modules/billing_portal/`):
  New `list_plans` action (read-only, `billing_portal.read` permission, no entitlement gate) reads
  `app/config/subscriptions.yaml` and returns the safe plan catalog (plan_id, label, description,
  capabilities, usage_limits). This is the canonical data source for the `/pricing` page — plan
  data is never hardcoded in page schemas or JSX. Handler and service stubs added.

- **MozaiksPay pricing page template** (`factory_app/build_context/mozaikspay/templates/ui/pages/pricing.yaml`):
  Pricing page template added to the mozaikspay capability pack, materialized into every app built
  with this pack. Shows plan catalog via `billing_portal/list_plans` (DataTable) and upgrade CTA
  via `billing_portal/open_billing_portal` (ActionButton). Fixed prior incorrect endpoint references
  (`/api/modules/billing/get_plans`, `/api/modules/billing/create_portal_session`) to the correct
  `billing_portal` module actions.

- **Quality gate corrections recording** (`tools/platform/gate_corrections_recorder.py`)
  — AppGenerator `on_complete` and `on_fail` lifecycle tool that reads the final status
  of all three quality gates (UI, module contract, module runtime) from context. For
  any gate in "blocked" status, POSTs a correction record to
  `build_intelligence.record_quality_gate_block`. Fires on both `on_complete` and
  `on_fail` so corrections are captured even when the build exits via failure.

- **Domain tags population** (`tools/platform/domain_tags_recorder.py`) — AppGenerator
  `on_complete` lifecycle tool that derives domain tags from selected capability pack IDs
  and POSTs to `build_intelligence.set_build_domain_tags`. Ensures `gate_failure` and
  `refinement_hotspot` patterns are domain-specific rather than always landing in
  domain `"global"`.

- **AG2 adapter layer** — concrete implementations for the AG2 beta execution model:
  `ag2_agent_runner.py` (single agent via `agent.ask()`), `ag2_network_runner.py`
  (multi-agent networks), `ag2_stream_storage.py` (token stream buffering),
  `ag2_task_batch_runner.py` (parallel task batches), `ag2_transition_conditions.py`
  (transition condition evaluators), and `docker_sandbox.py` (Docker sandbox adapter).

- **Workflow runtime modules** — `core/usage/` (token accounting and usage ledger),
  `workflow/agents/transition_graph.py` (declarative transition graph evaluator),
  `workflow/artifacts/` (artifact packaging), `workflow/context/projection.py`
  (scoped context projection), `workflow/contract_validation.py` (YAML contract
  validation), `workflow/execution/middleware.py` (lifecycle middleware hooks),
  `workflow/execution/run_bootstrap.py` (AG2 event-history run bootstrap), `workflow/outputs/`
  (runtime events and output validation).

- **`factory_app/build_context/`** — canonical location for named OSS build context
  packs. Each context directory holds `context.yaml` with explicit `assets[]` entries.
  Migrated from inline tool YAML: `AppGenerator` context (capability routing, domain
  catalogs, shell presets, module and workflow archetypes), `AgentGenerator` context
  (AG2 network patterns), `mozaikspay` context (contract + templates), and
  `webapp_builder` context (language profile).

- **`transition_graph.yaml` and `middleware.yaml`** added to all factory workflows
  (ExistingAppDiscovery, RuntimeSmoke, RuntimeTaskBatchSmoke, RuntimeToolCallSmoke,
  RuntimeUIPrimitiveSmoke, ThemeCapture, ValueEngine, DesignDocs, AppReview, plus the
  already-present AgentGenerator and AppGenerator). Every workflow now has complete
  explicit declarative routing and lifecycle hook config.

- **`RuntimeContextExpressionTaskBatchSmoke`** — new factory workflow that smoke-tests
  context expression evaluation in task batch runs.

- **`app/services/` adapter lane** — canonical location for app-owned service adapters.
  Structured as `adapters/deployment/`, `adapters/dns/`, `adapters/probes/`,
  and `adapters/registrar/` sub-directories. SaaS entitlement enforcement is
  provider-neutral OSS runtime behavior wired from `app/config/subscriptions.yaml`,
  not an app-owned service adapter.

- **`app/security/secrets.yaml`** — names-only secret contract resolved at startup by
  `mozaiksai/core/secrets/app_secrets.py`. Replaces the previous `app/config/secrets.yaml`
  convention.

- **`test_runtime_usage_layer.py`** — comprehensive OSS tests for the runtime
  usage accounting layer: `summarize_usage_events` (totals, by_workflow
  deduplication of chat IDs, by_run grouping and sorting), `estimate_token_cost`
  (explicit cost, negative/None/invalid fall-through, rate-based calculation,
  model-specific env var override, negative token clamping), ledger helper
  functions (`_int_value`, `_float_value`, `_text` edge cases), and
  `record_usage_delta` guard conditions (missing app_id/chat_id/workflow_name
  skip writes; `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` alias accepted) (40 tests).

- **`test_community_governance_module.py`** (mozaiks-app) — comprehensive
  governance service tests covering proposal lifecycle (create/open/close),
  member access control, admin bypass, snapshot building with delegation
  weight transfer, vote casting (duplicate, eligibility, delegated-voter zero
  power), outcome calculation (quorum thresholds, approved/rejected, idempotent
  re-calculation), delegation management (self-delegation, outbound chain limit,
  incoming delegation block, cycle detection via `_creates_cycle`), and
  revocation (own, admin override, non-admin blocked) (63 tests).

- **`test_mozaikspay_managed_capability_contract.py`** — new OSS test file that the
  production readiness gate requires. Covers context.yaml and contract.yaml
  contract shapes, all `required_outputs` having matching template files, the
  `forbidden_outputs` drift guard, `mozaikspay_client.py` provider-neutrality
  (no `import payment_provider`, no raw secrets, env-var–only URL resolution), the
  `billing_portal` facade module being app-owned (`owner: app`), page schemas
  routing through the facade rather than provider-owned modules directly, and a
  pack-wide drift guard (41 tests).

- **Managed-capability artifact replay gate** — production readiness now runs an
  offline AppGenerator replay that normalizes managed-capability plans, assembles
  deterministic pack templates, scans the final bundle for facade binding,
  adapter path, provider-internal path, and raw-secret drift, then runs the same
  assembled file map through deterministic app-bundle acceptance and the
  export-blocking `app_runtime_load` check.

- **`test_wallet_module.py`** (mozaiks-app) — comprehensive wallet service
  tests covering balance calculation, payout request guards (no payment provider account,
  amount exceeds available, zero amount, default-to-full-available), credit
  reactions (`credit_app_earnings`, `credit_investment_return`), payment provider webhook
  processing idempotency (`payout.paid`, `payout.failed`, already-terminal,
  transaction-not-found, unhandled event), managed wallet provisioning validation,
  wallet provisioning status with secret stripping, and repo
  collection aliases (61 tests).

- **`test_module_executor_dispatch.py`** — comprehensive OSS tests for the
  `ModuleExecutor` dispatch lifecycle: module/action resolution, sync and async
  dispatch, `action_method_map` aliasing, `EXECUTION_ERROR` / `INVALID_PARAMS`
  error codes, permission enforcement (trusted bypass, required present, missing,
  empty), entitlement gate (granted/denied/trusted-bypass/no-gate), input/output
  schema validation (output violations are warn-only), canonical event emitter
  envelope structure (`source.layer`, `source.app_id`, `source.module_id`,
  `actor.id`, no-actor when no user), and registry queries
  (`registered_modules`, `can_handle`, `health`) (29 tests).

- **`test_executor_registry.py`** — OSS unit tests for `ExecutorRegistry`:
  register/get/has/overwrite semantics for WORKFLOW and MODULE types, property
  shortcuts (`workflow_executor`, `module_executor`), `registered_types()` list
  accuracy, `summary()` type-to-class-name mapping, `ExecutorType` str-enum
  values, and `Executor` Protocol structural conformance (24 tests).

- **`test_platform_hook_registry.py`** — OSS unit tests for
  `PlatformHookRegistry`: empty no-op defaults, bundle registration from dict and
  object, `call_chat_prereqs` first-denial-wins/exception-tolerance/async support,
  `call_chat_session_fields` merge-and-tolerate, `call_workflow_ordering`
  hook-chain/non-list-return-ignored, `call_workflow_name_resolver`
  hook-override/case-insensitive-fallback/empty-string-falls-through,
  `run_startup` sync+async+exception-tolerance, `summary()` hook counts, singleton
  `reset()` (42 tests).

- **`test_build_intelligence_module.py`** (mozaiks-app) — comprehensive service
  tests for the new `build_intelligence` hosted module: `list_builds` owner
  scoping and status filter, `get_build` ownership query, `list_corrections`
  build-not-found guard, `get_domain_patterns` domain filter and limit clamping,
  `list_all_builds` no-owner-scope, `get_intelligence_summary` six-metric
  aggregation, `on_app_created` idempotency and ledger initialization,
  `on_build_status_updated` not-found/terminal fields/refinement-cycle
  increment/event emission, `module.yaml` contract (handler field, permissions,
  actions), and `events.yaml` payload schema contract (56 tests). Also fixes
  `module.yaml` missing `handler` field and registers `build_intelligence.builds`,
  `.corrections`, `.patterns` data aliases in `persistence.py`.

- **`test_messages_module.py`** (mozaiks-app) — comprehensive service tests for
  the `messages` module: `list_threads` owner scoping/status/limit, `get_thread`
  not-found/access-denied/unread-count/read-state-cursor, `create_thread`
  empty-title/creator-deduplication/event, `send_message` empty-body/too-long/
  not-found/non-participant/success (insert+preview+event+recipient-exclusion+
  preview-truncation+required-fields), `mark_thread_read` not-found/success
  (upsert+event+last-message-id), `list_notifications` user-scope/limit,
  `create_announcement` validation/insert/default-audience/event (52 tests).

- **`test_schema_migrations_module.py`** (mozaiks-app) — comprehensive service
  tests for `SchemaMigrationsService`: `get_schema_version` (no migrations →
  0.0.0, latest version, applied-status query), `list_migrations` (app scope,
  status filter, `status="all"` no filter), `record_migration` (duplicate
  rejected, pending status, recorded event, full field set), `run_migration` (not
  found, already applied, success path with multi-index ensure + applied event +
  update fields, failure path with exception → failed status + failed event)
  (32 tests).

- **`api-reference.md` and `token-management.md` expanded** — both docs
  under `docs/architecture/mozaiksai/` grew from placeholder stubs to accurate
  reference material: `api-reference.md` now lists every registered endpoint across
  runtime, platform, and Studio hosts with method/path/purpose; `token-management.md`
  documents `RuntimeUsageLedger`, `MozaiksUsageMiddleware`, `summarize_usage_events`,
  cost estimation, and the `/api/me/usage` surface with the subscription-limits
  contract.

- **Platform startup degradation** — `mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py` now captures
  module load errors at startup into `app.state.startup_degraded` and
  `app.state.startup_degraded_reason`. The `/api/health/ready` endpoint returns
  HTTP 503 with `app_startup: degraded: <reason>` when startup failed partially,
  so load balancers and healthchecks can detect a broken startup without the
  process crashing.

- **`runtime_extensions.yaml` placement warning** — `ModuleLoader` now logs a
  `WARNING` when `contracts/runtime_extensions.yaml` exists but
  `runtime_extensions.yaml` at the module root does not, guiding contributors to
  the correct placement.

- **`scope` capability in control-plane config** — `ControlPlaneConfig` now declares a
  dedicated `scope` capability block alongside `classifier`, `coding`, and
  `contract_surface`. `ScopeProposer` resolves its LLM config from `scope` first,
  falling back to `coding` when not declared. `runtime.yaml` wires `scope` to the
  `codegen` profile by default, giving operators an independent knob to tune or
  disable scope-proposal LLM usage without affecting code generation.

- **`WorkflowTransition.optional` field** — `WorkflowTransition` schema now accepts
  `optional: bool` (default `false`). Used by the `build_satisfaction_rating`
  transition in `extension_registry.json`. Previously caused a Pydantic
  `extra_forbidden` validation error when loading the global pack graph.

- **Task batch dependency deadlock fix** — under `failure_policy: continue_with_available`,
  tasks whose dependencies had already failed were left in `pending` forever, then
  triggered a misleading "unresolved or cyclic dependencies" error. The batch executor
  now drains dependency-blocked tasks immediately as `failed` (with reason
  `dependency '<id>' failed`) without requiring them to run.

- **Task batch silent empty-batch warning** — when `source.kind: structured_output` and
  `structured_output` is `None` or empty, the executor now emits a `WARNING` log
  identifying the batch ID, instead of silently producing zero task items.

- **`AG2TaskBatchRunner` module-level import** — moved from a lazy local import inside
  `_run_one_task` to a module-level import in `task_batches.py`, enabling standard
  `patch("mozaiksai.core.workflow.task_batches.AG2TaskBatchRunner")` in tests.

### Changed

- **`hosted-capability` / `hosted-packs` renamed to `managed-capability`** across
  AppGenerator tools, build contexts, rules, skills, docs, and tests. The term
  "managed capability" is now the canonical name for externally-hosted capability
  packs (e.g. `mozaikspay`, `managed_analytics`). All builder prompts, structured
  output models, build-plan validation, context hooks, and template resolution
  functions use the new name. `managed_billing` added to the subscription contract
  proprietary-term blocklist. `_split_mixed_module_contract_tasks` auto-split
  fallback removed; module contract tasks that include backend Python paths now
  raise `ValueError` immediately rather than silently splitting.

- AgentGenerator workflow bundle downloads now run a production quality gate before
  packaging, artifact registration, or promotion, blocking bundles with contract
  errors or semantic drift such as unresolved event triggers and serial task
  conveyors.

- AppGenerator app-bundle acceptance now blocks export when workflow integration
  drifts from AgentGenerator metadata, including mismatched trigger capability
  IDs, invented workflow capabilities, and ambiguous workflow trigger routing.

- AppGenerator page wiring validation now recognizes the platform-owned
  `/api/me/usage`, `/api/me/tokens`, and `/api/me/tokens/ledger` read endpoints
  for subscription/usage pages. AppGenerator and AgentGenerator prompts now copy
  subscription entitlement and metering declarations exactly instead of inventing
  app-owned ledgers or payment-provider internals.

- AppGenerator `ConfigMiddlewareAgent` now states the exact runtime-valid
  `ModuleContractBundle`, `module.yaml`, capability, typed schema, and YAML
  serialization shapes for module contract tasks, closing live semantic drift
  around missing actions, malformed handler methods, invented events, raw JSON
  schema maps, and invalid module YAML.

- AgentGenerator and AppGenerator now schedule bounded repair passes for
  quality-gate failures that map to generated workflow bundles or workflow
  integration YAML, keeping retries scoped to the failed artifact instead of
  restarting broad generation.

- Factory workflow validation now covers every workflow directory and registry
  sequence reference, including required declarative files, transition graph
  compilation, middleware import resolution, structured-output registry agents,
  and visual agent declarations. AppReview now ships the required
  `structured_outputs.yaml` contract.

- AgentGenerator conveyor workflow guidance now requires distinct downstream
  execution agents, and the live AgentGenerator pack smoke can exercise bounded
  workflow-bundle repair passes before retrying packaging.

- `AgentGenerator` and `AppGenerator` workflow contracts overhauled: removed
  `handoffs.yaml` and `hooks.yaml` (replaced by `transition_graph.yaml` and
  `middleware.yaml`). Static YAML catalogs (`module_archetypes.yaml`,
  `shell_presets.yaml`, `workflow_archetypes.yaml`, `capability_routing.yaml`,
  `file_contracts.yaml`, `domain_catalogs.yaml`) moved from inline tool files into
  `factory_app/build_context/AppGenerator/`. AgentGenerator `patternbook/` module
  moved to `tools/ag2_patterns.py` under `factory_app/build_context/AgentGenerator/`.

- `setup.py` removed; `pyproject.toml` is the sole package definition.

### Removed

- Deleted `mozaiksai/core/workflow/stream/` and `mozaiksai/core/workflow/streaming/` —
  handler-based stream architecture superseded by the inline `_forward_beta_events`
  AG2 beta MemoryStream subscription in `orchestration_patterns.py`.
- Deleted `mozaiksai/core/observability/ag2_runtime_logger.py` —
  `AG2RuntimeLoggingController` wrapped the pre-beta `autogen.runtime_logging`
  API, now superseded by the AG2 beta observer model. Removed `ag2_logging_session`
  context manager from `orchestration_patterns.py`.
- Deleted `mozaiksai/core/observability/realtime_token_logger.py` —
  `RealtimeTokenLogger` was only referenced from the deleted stream handlers.
- Deleted `mozaiksai/core/events/ag2_events.py` — custom AG2 event classes that
  used the `@wrap_event` decorator, which was removed in the AG2 beta. The single
  call site in `orchestration_patterns.py` was guarded by a silent `except Exception`
  and had no actual subscribers; removed together with the try/except guard.
- Deleted `tests/test_realtime_token_logger.py` and `tests/test_mozaiks_event_handler.py`
  alongside their subject modules.

### Added

- **`EntitlementPort`** — new runtime port (`mozaiksai/core/ports/entitlement.py`)
  that gives the platform a deterministic enforcement hook for SaaS feature gating.
  `ModuleExecutor` checks `ActionDef.entitlement_gate` before dispatching any action
  that declares one. `NoOpEntitlementAdapter` (the default) grants every capability —
  non-SaaS apps are completely unaffected. SaaS apps declare
  `app/config/subscriptions.yaml`; the platform wires the OSS
  `ConfiguredEntitlementAdapter`, which reads assignment state from the configured
  app data alias.

- **`ActionDef.entitlement_gate`** — new optional field on module action declarations.
  Set to a `capability_id` string (e.g. `"wallet.view"`) to gate the action behind an
  active plan grant. Never set on `admin_internal` actions. The `ModuleLoader` reads and
  validates it; `ModuleExecutor` enforces it at dispatch time with error code
  `ENTITLEMENT_REQUIRED`. `ModuleDefinition.action_entitlement_map` exposes the full
  module→action→capability_id index.

- **`app/config/subscriptions.yaml`** — canonical SaaS plan catalog for generated
  apps. It declares plan IDs, labels, granted capability IDs, optional usage limits,
  and optional assignment-store mapping used by `ConfiguredEntitlementAdapter`.
  App-owned payment providers update assignment records; AppGenerator must not
  generate a separate entitlement adapter.

- **`pack_overlay` task contract** added to `file_contracts.yaml` — canonical file
  boundaries and hard constraints for AppGenerator's framework pack wiring tasks.
  `ConfigMiddlewareAgent` gained Mode C guidance covering the full entitlements pack
  overlay output (facade module, billing reactions, grant adapter, self-hosted modules).

- `contracts/profile.yaml` is now a first-class AppGenerator output. AppGenerator
  gained three typed structured-output models (`ModuleProfileField`,
  `ModuleProfilePanel`, `ModuleProfileManifest`) and a `profile_yaml` field on
  `ModuleContractBundle`. `ConfigMiddlewareAgent` now has explicit authoring
  guidance (step 9a) covering when to emit, kind rules (`metrics`, `list`,
  `component`), field type constraints, action binding, and hard exclusions
  (`form` kind, admin-only actions, secrets). All four module archetypes
  (`standard`, `messaging`, `workflow`, `transactional`) list `profile.yaml` in
  their optional YAML family. The runtime's module contract codegen already
  materialises `contracts/profile.yaml` — this change closes the generation-side
  gap.

- `docs/architecture/app/refinement-harness.md` — canonical reference for
  app-local refinement harnesses. Covers when to use a pack, the full file
  layout, annotated starter templates for all four config files
  (`runtime.yaml`, `harness.yaml`, `tools.yaml`, `policies.yaml`), prompt
  starters for all four LLM-backed checkpoints, and route rules. This is the
  authoritative AppGenerator reference for `refinement_harness` build tasks.

- `WorkflowEntry` in the pack-graph schema now accepts a `startup_mode` field
  (`UserDriven`, `AgentDriven`, or `BackendOnly`). `GlobalPackGraph` enforces
  that `BackendOnly` workflows are not placed in `workflow_sequences` or
  assigned entrypoints — they are domain-event-triggered only.
- `PackGraphWorkflow` in AgentGenerator's structured output now carries
  `startup_mode` so generated workflow bundles declare the correct entry
  classification from the start.
- All seven factory workflows in `extension_registry.json` now carry explicit
  `startup_mode` annotations (`ValueEngine` and `ExistingAppDiscovery` are
  `UserDriven`; the rest are `AgentDriven`).

### Changed

- `docs/architecture/workflows/refinement-harness-architecture.md` updated:
  file trees corrected (added `contract_surface_planner.py`, `runtime.yaml`,
  `contract_surface_selection_system.yaml`, all 11 context tools); new "AG2
  Implementation Model" section covering `agent.ask()` pattern, structured
  output enforcement, `agent_factory` injection, and LLM config resolution;
  full six-checkpoint runtime flow; expanded "Generated App Authoring" section
  pointing to the new starter pack reference.
- `docs/guides/platform-intelligence/03-refinement.md` updated with a
  "How Classification Works" and "How Patch Coding Works" section explaining
  the AG2-backed classifier and coding worker, plus an "Opting In" section
  showing the `app/config/ai.json` control plane block.

- `LLMChangeClassifier` and `ScopedRefinementCodingWorker` in the control plane
  now use `autogen.beta.Agent.ask()` with `MemoryStream`, `RetryMiddleware`, and
  `TokenMonitor` instead of a raw `generate_json_completion()` call. Both classes
  accept an `agent_factory` parameter for test injection; their tests now use a
  `_FakeAgent`/`_FakeReply` pattern that exercises the full classify/execute path
  without hitting the network.

- `DataContract` structured output model for AppGenerator now includes a
  `surfaces` field (list of `DataContractSurface`) with fully typed sub-models
  (`DataContractCollection`, `DataContractOwnership`, `DataContractLifecycle`,
  `DataContractField`, `DataContractIndex`, `DataContractIndexKey`). This
  matches what the `_validate_data_contract` runtime gate and the data-contract
  loader both expect, and keeps `AppSchemaOutput` and `AppBuildPlanOutput`
  compatible with provider strict structured-output mode.
- AppGenerator now seeds generated app bundles with `config/ai.json` from the
  current factory runtime defaults, and `refinement_harness` outputs now stage
  `app/config/refinement_policy.yaml` alongside `harness.yaml` and
  `tools.yaml`. This keeps `ask` / `chat` / `workflows` startup in `ai.json`
  while moving app-local control-plane runtime policy under
  `refinement_harness/config/`.
- `IntegrationTestAgent` removed from the AppGenerator agent roster.
  Integration and wiring validation (`run_integration_tests`,
  `validate_wiring`) are deterministic runtime-gate tools called by
  `AppValidationAgent`'s auto-invoked gate — they are no longer exposed as
  agent-callable tools.

### Fixed

- **Partial module load now surfaces as `startup_degraded`** — when one or more
  declared modules fail to load, `mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py` now sets
  `app.state.startup_degraded = True` with a `MODULE_LOAD_PARTIAL` reason string.
  The `/api/health/ready` endpoint returns HTTP 503 in this state, so load
  balancers and health checks detect a degraded startup without the process
  crashing. Previously the platform silently continued with a partial module set
  and returned 200.

- **`ModuleLoader.load_all()` returns `(loaded, failed_names)` tuple** — the
  return type changed from `list[LoadedModule]` to
  `tuple[list[LoadedModule], list[str]]`. Callers that previously discarded
  failures silently now receive the list of failed module IDs. `AppLoadResult`
  gains a `failed_module_names: list[str]` field that propagates the set of
  modules that could not be loaded.

- **Coding worker sets `status="failed"` on artifact persistence error** — when
  `_persist_validated_artifact()` raises, the control-plane coding worker now
  flips `status` to `"failed"` and sets `result.error` to
  `ARTIFACT_PERSISTENCE_FAILED: <cause>`. Previously the status remained
  `"validated"` even though no artifact record existed in the store, masking the
  failure as a success.

- **Zipfile creation errors wrapped as `ARTIFACT_ZIP_FAILED`** — `OSError`
  exceptions from `zipfile.ZipFile` construction in the coding worker are now
  re-raised as `RuntimeError("ARTIFACT_ZIP_FAILED: ...")` with a clear path and
  cause, instead of propagating a bare OS error.

- **`asyncio.create_task()` for workflow auto-start now logs unexpected errors**
  — the fire-and-forget `_auto_start_if_needed()` task in `platform.py` now
  attaches a `done_callback` that logs any unexpected exception at `ERROR` level.
  Previously, unhandled exceptions from that task were silently discarded by the
  event loop.

- **Module router/service startup failures now mark platform degraded** —
  `mount_module_routers()` and `start_module_services()` failures were previously
  logged at `WARNING` only, allowing the process to boot with silently broken
  module extensions (causing 404s on mounted routes or missing background
  services). Both now log at `ERROR` and set `startup_degraded = True`.

- **`/api/health/ready` response includes `failed_modules` list** — when any
  modules fail to load, the readiness response body now includes a
  `failed_modules: list[str]` field alongside the existing degraded reason
  string, allowing programmatic consumers to identify which modules to inspect
  without parsing the reason string.

- **`app.state.failed_module_names` persisted for structured access** — the list
  of modules that failed to load at startup is now available on `app.state` for
  the full lifetime of the process, not just in the startup logs.

- **Dispatch to startup-failed module returns 503 not 404** —
  `_execute_module_action` now checks `app.state.failed_module_names` before
  forwarding to the executor. When a request targets a module known to have
  failed at startup, it returns HTTP 503 with a clear "failed to load at startup"
  message instead of falling through to the executor's generic `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`
  (404) response.

- **`WORKSPACE_SNAPSHOT_ZIP_FAILED` error wrapping** — `OSError` exceptions from
  `mkdir()` and `ZipFile()` in the workspace snapshot writer are now re-raised as
  `RuntimeError("WORKSPACE_SNAPSHOT_ZIP_FAILED: ...")`, consistent with the same
  pattern in the coding worker.

- **`asyncio.create_task()` for AgentDriven websocket auto-start logs errors** —
  `runtime.py` AgentDriven workflow auto-start task now attaches a `done_callback`
  that logs `AGENTDRIVEN_AUTO_START_FAILED` at `ERROR` level.

- **Context variable persistence errors now logged** — `context/adapter.py`
  previously swallowed all errors in `persist_context_variables()` fire-and-forget
  calls with `except Exception: pass`. Errors are now logged at `WARNING` level
  (`CONTEXT_PERSIST_FAILED` / `CONTEXT_PERSIST_TASK_CREATION_FAILED`), making
  workflow state drift observable without crashing the runtime.

- Fixed AppReview revision handoff so review-session revisions preserve
  `artifact_key`, `artifact_version_id`, `source_surface`, lifecycle state, and
  staged bundle path when triggering Studio refinement. The AppReview summary
  now exposes promotion readiness from deterministic build context instead of
  allowing promotion with incomplete handoff metadata, promotes the reviewed
  artifact version through Studio before activating the app registry record,
  restores generated app zips as a loadable active app root even when the zip
  contains a single `GeneratedApp/` wrapper, and confirmation-required refinement
  routes now surface through the shared pending harness decision UI.

- Fixed `F821` undefined-name crashes in `mozaiksai/core/runtime/app/ai_config.py`
  (missing `from typing import Any`) and
  `factory_app/workflows/AppGenerator/tools/hook_file_contract_context.py`
  (missing `from pathlib import Path`). Both were live runtime crashes on any call
  path that triggered annotation evaluation under a non-postponed context.

- Fixed `supports_provider_response_format` incorrectly returning `True` for
  `dict[str, Any] | None`-style annotations in
  `mozaiksai/core/workflow/outputs/structured.py`. Python 3.10+ `X | Y` syntax
  creates `types.UnionType`, not `typing.Union`, so the previous `origin is Union`
  guard missed it. Both union origin check sites now use
  `_UNION_ORIGINS = (Union, types.UnionType)`.

- Fixed `app/services/adapters/` files importing from `app.modules.*`, violating
  the adapter boundary contract. `dns/azure_dns.py` and `dns/cloudflare.py` now
  import `DnsRecord`, `DnsZone`, and `ProviderNotConfiguredError` from a new
  `adapters/dns/schemas.py`; `registrar/godaddy.py` and `registrar/opensrs.py`
  import from `adapters/registrar/schemas.py`; `deployment/build/github_actions_build.py`
  imports constants from the co-located `provider_connection_contract.py`. Module
  backends re-export the exception type from the adapter layer to preserve existing
  call sites.

- Fixed `BuildIntelligenceService.record_quality_gate_block` — correction records
  were missing `correction_id`; unknown `gate_type` values were silently accepted
  instead of returning an error. Fixed `list_builds` and `list_corrections` to
  strip MongoDB `_id` and undeclared internal fields from serialized responses.

- Fixed `build_intelligence/runtime_extensions.yaml` — schema had extra fields
  (`id`, `description`, `mount_prefix`, top-level `module_id`) and a dict-form
  `entrypoint` that `ModuleRuntimeExtensionsManifest` rejects. Corrected to the
  canonical `entrypoint: backend.telemetry_router:router` / `prefix:` shape.

- Renamed internal platform reaction event type from `platform.subscription.{kind}_requested`
  to `platform.reaction.{kind}_dispatched` in `module_event_router.py`. The previous name
  was misleading — it described the reaction routing mechanism but looked like a SaaS
  billing subscription event. Also renamed the `subscription_id` payload field to
  `reaction_id`. No change in behavior; this was internal platform event naming only.

- Tightened five `schema_version` fields in AppGenerator `structured_outputs.yaml`
  from `type: str` to `type: literal` with their correct values
  (`mozaiks.events.v1`, `mozaiks.reactions.v1`, `mozaiks.notifications.v1`,
  `mozaiks.settings.v1`, `mozaiks.admin.v2`). Wrong schema versions now fail at
  structured-output parse time rather than at runtime module loader validation.
- Fixed `overflow_behavior` in `ControlPlaneScopePolicies` — valid runtime values
  are `clarify` and `workflow`; the previously declared `fail` literal was rejected
  by the runtime loader.

- Fixed `DatabaseAgent` OUTPUT FORMAT example, which contained a `"{...}"`
  placeholder as the `data_contract_json` file content. The LLM was copying
  this literally, writing `{...}` into `config/data.json` for all generated
  apps. The example now shows the correct `DataContract` shape with `surfaces`,
  `surface_id`, and `collections`.
- Fixed `DesignDocs` `workflow_startup_mode` from `BackendOnly` to
  `AgentDriven`. DesignDocs runs in sequence-driven builds; it is not a
  domain-event-triggered workflow.
- Fixed strict structured-output schemas for workflow planners by marking
  declared fields as truly required in generated Pydantic models. This restores
  provider-enforced `response_format` compatibility for live AG2 workflow runs
  such as `RuntimeTaskBatchSmoke` and related planner-driven smokes.

- Fixed OpenAI strict structured-output mode compatibility for all control-plane
  response schemas. `CodingWorkerPlan`, `SurfaceRegenerationResponse`,
  `ScopeProposal`, `_SurfaceEntry`, and `_ContractSurfaceClassification` had
  fields with defaults that caused those fields to be excluded from Pydantic's
  `required[]`, violating the strict-mode requirement that every property appear
  in `required`. All defaults stripped; every property is now required. Introduced
  `FileUpdate(path, content)` model replacing `dict[str, str]` for the
  `updated_files` field — `dict[str, str]` generates
  `"additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}` which strict mode rejects;
  `list[FileUpdate]` generates an array of objects with `additionalProperties: false`.

- Fixed `codegen`, `planner_replanner`, and `reviewer_validator` LLM profiles in
  `factory_app/refinement_harness/config/runtime.yaml` — previously set to
  `gpt-5.2-codex`, which is a completions-only model that returns a 404 from
  `/v1/chat/completions`. Changed to `gpt-4o` with `temperature: 0.1`.

- Fixed stale `WorkflowStrategyAgent` references in AgentGenerator.
  `WorkflowStrategyAgent` was replaced by `PatternAgent` in a prior refactor but
  two stale references remained: (1) `WorkflowBundleBuilderAgent` EVENT BOUNDARY
  RULES referenced `WorkflowStrategy.event_boundary.input_events`, a context
  variable that no longer exists; replaced with `backend_design_document` and the
  `initial_message` trigger contract. (2) `hook_universal_prompts.py`
  `workflow_design_agents` named `WorkflowStrategyAgent`, so the `RUNTIME_CONTEXT`
  injection never fired for any live agent; replaced with `WorkflowBundleBuilderAgent`.

- Fixed live control-plane classifier calls against models that only support
  the provider default temperature. `SimpleLLMCapabilityService` now omits the
  `temperature` field for JSON completions when no explicit value is configured.

- Fixed B904 raise-without-from violations: 16 files had `raise X` inside
  `except` blocks without `from err`. All `except ExceptionType:` bare clauses
  that needed chaining now bind the exception (`except ExceptionType as exc:`),
  and the corresponding `raise` uses `raise X from exc`. One syntax error in
  `registry.py` (misplaced `from exc` inside constructor call) was also repaired.

- Fixed `normalize_app_path` stripping leading dots from dotdir names
  (`.github/workflows/` → `github/workflows/`). The previous `lstrip("./")` treated
  `.` and `/` as individual strip characters, incorrectly stripping `.github` to
  `github`. Now strips `./` and `../` as sequences only, preserving dot-prefixed
  paths like `.github/`.

- Zero ruff violations (`ruff check . → All checks passed`). Suppressed
  `E402` (intentional lazy imports) and `B008` (FastAPI `Depends()`) globally
  in `pyproject.toml`. Fixed: `E722` bare except in `db_manager.py`, `F402`
  import shadowed by loop var in `connector_health.py`, `UP035`/`F401`
  obsolete `typing.Dict` in transport handlers, `B017` blind exception in 8
  subscription loader tests (`Exception` → `ValidationError`), `UP007`/`UP045`
  `Optional`/`Union` annotations in `structured.py` and tests, `E741` ambiguous
  variable name `l` → `ln` in 3 test files, `E702`/`E701` multi-statement lines
  in `logging_config.py`, and `UP007` `EventType` union in
  `unified_event_dispatcher.py`.
- Fixed three stale test assertions in `test_module_contract_quality_gate.py`
  and `test_module_runtime_quality_gate.py` that checked the removed `condition`
  string field instead of `condition_value`.

- **`exc_info=True` added to `MODULE_LOAD_FAILED` error log** — the module
  loader now captures full stack traces (not just the message string) when a
  module fails to load, making root-cause debugging of startup failures
  significantly easier.

- **`WORKFLOW_BACKGROUND_TASK_FAILED` done_callback on all workflow handler
  background tasks** — three `asyncio.create_task(_run_workflow_background(...))`
  calls in `workflow_handlers.py` (switch-workflow auto-start, start-workflow
  auto-run, and batch auto-run) now attach done_callbacks that log
  `WORKFLOW_BACKGROUND_TASK_FAILED` at `ERROR` level when the task raises.

- **`HANDOFF_EVENT_EMIT_FAILED` done_callback** — `loop.create_task()` in
  `handoff_events.py` now logs `HANDOFF_EVENT_EMIT_FAILED` at `WARNING` when
  the event dispatch coroutine raises.

- **`ADMIN_REGISTRY_LOAD_FAILED` warning on corrupt registry YAML** —
  `load_admin_registry()` silently returned an empty registry on YAML parse
  errors; now logs a `WARNING` with path and exception.

- **`CONTENT_STORE_PUT_BUNDLE_FAILED` warning on non-local content store
  upload failures** — artifact promotion silently set `content_ref = None`
  when the remote bundle upload failed; now logs a `WARNING` with app ID,
  artifact ID, backend name, and exception.

- **Debug-only `logger.info` calls removed from hot paths** — three
  `🔍`-prefixed `logger.info` calls in `unified_event_dispatcher.py` and
  `simple_transport.py` that fired on every agent message or event were either
  removed or downgraded to `DEBUG`. These would have flooded production log
  aggregation at any realistic message throughput.

- **Per-message `INFO` suppression logs downgraded to `DEBUG`** —
  `SYSTEM_SIGNAL`, `USERDRIVEN_TRIGGER`, and `UI_HIDDEN` suppression logs
  in the event dispatcher, plus `INPUT_SUBMIT`, visual-agents gate, and
  `_mozaiks_hide` suppression logs in the transport, now emit at `DEBUG` level
  instead of `INFO`. Also removed a per-registry loop that dumped all pending
  input request IDs to info on every input submit call.

- **Per-operation `INFO` logs downgraded to `DEBUG`** — per-document-insert
  log in `db_manager.py`, per-session-creation and per-artifact-state-update
  logs in `simple_transport.py` downgraded from `INFO` to `DEBUG`.

- **`AI_CONFIG_LOAD_FAILED` and `CONTROL_PLANE_CONFIG_LOAD_FAILED` warnings**
  — `load_ai_config_json()` and `load_control_plane_config_yaml()` were
  silently returning empty dicts on JSON/YAML parse errors, making startup
  misconfiguration invisible. Both now emit `WARNING` logs with the config
  path and exception.

- **Stale refinement router artifact lookups now log at DEBUG** — two bare
  `except Exception: return []` / `return None` blocks in
  `refinement_router.py` that silently swallowed artifact store lookup errors
  now log `ARTIFACT_FILES_LOOKUP_FAILED` and `STALE_ARTIFACT_LOOKUP_FAILED`
  at `DEBUG` level.

- **`exc_info=True` added to all critical `logger.error()` calls** — a sweep
  across auth, persistence, transport, and event dispatch layers fixed
  `logger.error(f"...{e}")` calls that were logging exception messages as
  strings without capturing stack traces. Affected: `auth/websocket_auth.py`,
  `auth/adapters/jwt_adapter.py`, `auth/adapters/keycloak.py`,
  `auth/adapters/supabase.py`, `auth/adapters/registry.py`,
  `auth/jwt_validator.py`, `data/persistence/persistence_manager.py`,
  `data/persistence/db_manager.py`, `events/unified_event_dispatcher.py`,
  `transport/simple_transport.py`, and `transport/workflow_bridge.py`. Also
  removed an unused `import traceback` from `simple_transport.py` and cleaned
  up emoji prefixes from `db_manager.py` error logs.

- **`APP_MANIFEST_LOAD_FAILED` warning on corrupt app manifest** — platform
  host `_load_app_manifest()` was silently returning empty dict when
  `app.json` was corrupt or malformed; now emits a `WARNING` log with path
  and exception so startup misconfiguration is visible.

- **`WS_PREREQ_VALIDATION_FAILED` error log in runtime websocket handler** —
  the runtime WebSocket endpoint caught prerequisite validation exceptions and
  sent a `chat.error` to the client but logged nothing, leaving operators with
  no visibility into the failure cause. Now logs at `ERROR` level with workflow
  name, chat ID, and exception.

- **`logger.error(f"...")` anti-pattern eliminated across workflow and UI layers**
  — `workflow_manager.py`, `ui_tools.py`, `factory.py`, and `module_loader.py`
  had `logger.error(f"...{exc}")` calls that evaluated eagerly and lost stack
  traces. All converted to `logger.error("...", arg, exc_info=True)`. Affected
  log events: `WORKFLOW_LOAD_FAILED`, `WORKFLOW_LOAD_ALL_FAILED`,
  `WORKFLOW_MODULE_RELOAD_FAILED`, `WORKFLOW_RELOAD_FAILED`,
  `AI_CONFIG_READ_FAILED`, `UI_TOOL_INTERACTION_FAILED`, `MODULE_LOAD_FAILED`.
  Also removed debug emoji prefixes (`❌`, `📈`) from `ui_tools.py` and
  downgraded a per-tool-call `INFO` to `DEBUG`.

- **325 G004 lazy-logging violations eliminated** — all `logger.xxx(f"...")`
  f-string calls across 35 `mozaiksai/` files converted to `%`-format lazy
  interpolation. F-strings inside logging calls evaluate even when the log level
  suppresses output; `%`-format defers string construction to the log handler.
  Files affected span admin, auth adapters, data/persistence, events, runtime
  composition, transport, and all workflow sub-layers.

- **Silent `except Exception: pass` blocks replaced with debug logs** —
  `orchestration_patterns.py` had 7 bare pass-through swallows in critical
  paths (frontend context lookup, context injection, agent/context registry
  stores, derived listener setup, context manager registration, on_fail lifecycle
  trigger, and error event emission). `auto_tool_handler.py` had 2 inner-loop
  swallows. `db_manager.py` had 2 collection-drop swallows. All now emit
  `logger.debug(...)` with event key and cause, making previously invisible
  failures observable without impacting steady-state performance.

- **`asyncio.create_task()` lifecycle emission errors now surfaced** —
  `workflow_bridge.py` had 5 bare `asyncio.create_task()` calls for lifecycle
  event emissions (`_emit_execution_started`, `_emit_execution_completed`,
  `_emit_execution_failed`, and two `dispatcher.emit("runtime.process_completed")`
  calls). All now attach `add_done_callback()` that logs at `WARNING` when the
  task raises, ending the silent discard of lifecycle event failures.

- **Artifact promotion partial-write now raises instead of silently continuing**
  — when `artifact_store.set_validation_status()` fails after
  `content_store.put_bundle()` succeeds, the bundle is in the content store but
  the DB record has stale metadata. Previously this was silently swallowed.
  Now logs `ARTIFACT_STATUS_UPDATE_FAILED` at `ERROR` level with app ID,
  artifact ID, content ref, and exception, then re-raises so callers see the
  failure.

- **Control-plane config disabled state now logged at startup** —
  `load_control_plane_config()` was silently returning a disabled
  `ControlPlaneConfig()` when the YAML file existed but failed to parse, making
  it impossible to distinguish "no config file" from "corrupt config file".
  Now emits `CONTROL_PLANE_DISABLED` at `WARNING` when a parseable config path
  exists but yields no valid data, and `CONTROL_PLANE_CONFIG_LOADED` at `INFO`
  on successful load (with `enabled` flag and path).

### Security

- **WebSocket JWT expiry not enforced on inbound messages** — the runtime
  `handle_websocket()` validated the auth token only at connection time.
  Authenticated sessions with expired tokens could continue sending messages
  indefinitely after token expiry. Fixed by extracting the JWT `exp` claim in
  `runtime.py` and passing it as `token_exp` to `simple_transport.handle_websocket()`.
  The inbound message loop now checks `time.time() > token_exp` before each
  dispatch and closes the connection with WebSocket code 4401 when the token
  has expired.

- **Duplicate WebSocket connection overwrote active session silently** — when a
  second connection arrived for the same `chat_id`, the plain dict assignment
  `self.connections[chat_id] = {...}` replaced the existing entry while the old
  connection's `finally` block was still running. The `finally` block then
  deleted the new connection entry, leaving subsequent messages with no routing
  target. Fixed by evicting the stale connection explicitly before registering
  the new one: close the stale WebSocket with code 1001, call
  `_cleanup_connection()`, then proceed with the new registration.

- **Inbound WebSocket messages had no size limit** — the HTTP chat endpoint
  enforced `_MESSAGE_MAX_CHARS` but the WebSocket path was unbounded, allowing
  clients to send arbitrarily large payloads that would be parsed and forwarded
  into the workflow context. Fixed by reading `CHAT_MESSAGE_MAX_CHARS` from the
  environment in `SimpleTransport.__init__` and rejecting oversized messages with
  a `MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE` client error before JSON parsing.

- **`_input_request_registries` memory leak on disconnect** — the pending input
  request registry for a chat session was not cleaned up in `_cleanup_connection()`.
  Any client that disconnected mid-workflow left its input registry entry in
  memory indefinitely. Fixed by adding cleanup of `_input_request_registries`
  in `ws_protocol.py`'s `_cleanup_connection()`.

- **Silent `except Exception: pass` blocks replaced in bridge and dispatcher** —
  `workflow_bridge.py` had 8 bare pass swallows across lifecycle emission task
  creation, `fail_active_revision` fire-and-forget, pause-workflow registry
  cleanup, and session-registry complete calls. `unified_event_dispatcher.py` had
  4 bare pass swallows in per-event agent-flag enrichment (structured/visual/
  ui_tools/sequence flag lookup). All now emit `logger.debug(...)` with event key
  and cause so previously invisible failures are observable in debug log streams.

- **Silent failures surfaced in AG2 runner, attachments, auth, and LLM config** —
  `ag2_network_runner.py`: hub client and hub `close()` calls in the cleanup
  `finally` block now log `WARNING` on failure; cancelled pending tasks are now
  awaited with `return_exceptions=True` to prevent use-after-close races with the
  hub. `chat_attachments/attachments.py`: file-close and bundle-read errors log
  `WARNING` instead of silently continuing. `auth/dependencies.py` and
  `auth/websocket_auth.py`: adapter exception in no-auth mode logs `DEBUG` before
  falling back to the anonymous user. `capabilities/simple_llm.py`: invalid
  temperature in `llm_config` logs `WARNING` and falls back to API default instead
  of crashing or silently using an unvalidated value.

- **Silent failures surfaced in content store, app context, and admin** —
  `artifacts/content_store.py`: `exists()` and `delete()` now log `ERROR` with
  `exc_info=True` when GridFS queries fail, preventing a DB outage from
  masquerading as "content not found" or "content deleted". `app_context/store.py`:
  JSON and YAML manifest parse failures now log `WARNING` instead of returning
  empty objects silently. `admin/router.py`: session runtime computation failure
  logs `WARNING` and falls back to stored duration. `app_context/context_graph.py`:
  tree-sitter parser init failure logs `WARNING` when permanently disabling the
  parser for the process lifetime.

- **Remaining bare `except Exception: pass` blocks replaced in transport layer** —
  `simple_transport.py` had 6 bare pass swallows: 3 in run-complete event
  enrichment and 3 in `RUNTIME_PROCESS_COMPLETED` hook. All replaced with
  `logger.debug(...)`. `orchestration_patterns.py`: 4 additional bare passes in
  derived-context seed, `mark_chat_completed` persistence, derived-context manager
  cleanup, and the `_derived_listener` UI emit task were replaced with debug/warning
  logs and a `done_callback`.

- **Platform shutdown and orchestration cleanup observability** —
  `hosts/platform.py`: runtime-services stop failure at shutdown now logs
  `WARNING`; two WebSocket prerequisite error-message send failures log `DEBUG`
  instead of silently swallowing. `orchestration_patterns.py`: fire-and-forget UI
  emit task in `_derived_listener` now attaches a `done_callback` that logs the
  exception at `DEBUG` when the task raises.

- **`http_app_backend.py` and `summary_artifacts.py` non-JSON response warnings**
  — `HttpAppBackendAdapter` now logs `WARNING` when a 2xx response body fails JSON
  decode (previously silently fell back to `{"raw": ...}`). `summary_artifacts.py`
  logs `WARNING` when Pydantic `model_dump` fails during artifact JSON
  serialization.

- **WebSocket connection limit (`MOZAIKS_MAX_WS_CONNECTIONS`)** — `SimpleTransport`
  now reads `MOZAIKS_MAX_WS_CONNECTIONS` (default 500) from the environment and
  rejects new connections with WebSocket close code 1008 when the limit is reached.
  Reconnect storms from misbehaving clients can no longer grow `self.connections`
  without bound.

- **AG2 runner outer timeout guard** — `ag2_network_runner.py`'s `asyncio.wait()`
  call had no native deadline; a hung `failure_task` could block the runner
  indefinitely. Added an `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=close_timeout + 30s)` outer
  guard that cancels both tasks and returns `RunStatus.PAUSED` with an explanatory
  error when the deadline is exceeded.

- **WebSocket idle timeout (`MOZAIKS_WS_IDLE_TIMEOUT`) detects half-open TCP
  connections** — heartbeat `send_json` can succeed on half-open TCP connections
  because the OS kernel buffers absorb the bytes before the remote end's failure
  is detected. `SimpleTransport` now tracks `last_received_at` on every inbound
  message. The `ws_protocol.py` heartbeat loop reads `MOZAIKS_WS_IDLE_TIMEOUT`
  (default 360 s) and closes the connection when no message has been received
  within the idle window, cleaning up the slot for a reconnect.

- **HTTP 500 responses no longer leak internal exception details to clients** —
  `runtime.py` registers a global `HTTPException` handler that intercepts
  status-500 responses, logs the original detail at `WARNING` server-side, and
  returns `{"detail": "Internal server error"}` to the caller. Prevents
  database addresses, file paths, and exception messages embedded in
  `f"Failed to ... {exc}"` detail strings from reaching API consumers.
  4xx and 5xx non-500 codes (503 operational messages) pass through unchanged.

- **Dead `_resolve_agent_log_limit` / `_AGENT_CONV_*` declarations removed** —
  `persistence_manager.py` declared `_resolve_agent_log_limit`,
  `_AGENT_CONV_JSON_MAX_LEN`, and `_AGENT_CONV_TEXT_MAX_LEN` but never applied
  the limits anywhere in the source (only in a stale `build/` copy). Removed
  all three, plus the seven `TestResolveAgentLogLimit` test cases, to eliminate
  dead feature stubs that implied a false safety guarantee.

- **Per-request INFO logs in `platform.py`, `orchestration_patterns.py`,
  `simple_transport.py`, and `connector_service.py` downgraded to DEBUG** —
  `CHAT_START_WORKFLOW_NORMALIZED`, `WS_WORKFLOW_NORMALIZED`,
  `SESSION_REGISTRY_CLEANUP`, `CONFIG: mode=…`, `Lifecycle before_chat
  completed`, `UserDriven greeting sent`, `Launching workflow`, `WebSocket
  closed normally`, and seven connector-service status calls now emit at
  `DEBUG`. Connector secret-persist failure promoted from `INFO` to `WARNING`.
  `GENERAL_CHAT_SESSION_CREATED` converted from `extra={}` dict logging to
  positional structured format at `DEBUG`.

- **Emoji characters removed from all log messages and remaining per-call INFO
  logs downgraded to DEBUG** — `simple_transport.py`, `ui_tools.py`,
  `lifecycle.py`, `handoff_events.py`, `unified_event_dispatcher.py`,
  `persistence_manager.py`, and `auto_tool_handler.py` contained multi-byte
  emoji characters (🎯, ✅, ✗, ⚠️, 🔍, ⏳) that confuse production log
  aggregators and indicate per-request verbosity. All emoji removed; hot-path
  calls in UI tool processing, auto-tool dedup, gather-agent-JSON loops,
  lifecycle completions, and visual-agent filtering downgraded from `INFO` to
  `DEBUG`. `workflow_manager.py` `WORKFLOW_LOAD_OK` kept at `INFO` (startup,
  not per-call).

- **MongoDB reachability added to startup validation** — `run_startup_checks()`
  now verifies that `MONGO_URI` is set (or resolvable via Key Vault alias
  `MongoURI`) and that the MongoDB server responds to a `ping` before accepting
  traffic. Missing URI and ping failures emit `STARTUP_CHECK_FAILED` records
  with `check="mongo_uri"` and raise `StartupConfigError` in `strict` mode.
  Five new tests cover the success and failure paths; existing tests updated to
  inject `_MockPingClient` so the new check does not change their assertions.

- **Per-request INFO logs in transport handlers converted to DEBUG and
  f-string lazy-logging fixed** — `input_handlers.py`, `mode_handlers.py`,
  and `workflow_handlers.py` had 11 `logger.info(f"...")` calls that fired at
  `INFO` on every user input, mode switch, and workflow start, flooding
  production log aggregators at any realistic throughput. All converted to
  `logger.debug("...", arg, ...)` with structured `KEY=value` names.
  Eliminates the last G004 f-string lazy-logging violations in `mozaiksai/`.

- **Tab indentation in `event_serialization.py` replaced with 4-space groups**
  — this was the only file in `mozaiksai/` using tab indentation (245 tabs).
  Converted via `expandtabs(4)` to match the rest of the runtime codebase and
  avoid parser inconsistencies in mixed-indentation edge cases.

- **Redundant lazy `import logging` inside `except` block removed** —
  `control_plane/implementations/coding_worker.py` imported
  `logging as _logging` inside an `except` block at line 446 even though
  `import logging; logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` was already at the
  top of the file. Fixed to use the module-level `logger` directly.

- **WebSocket connection limit and idle timeout test coverage added** —
  7 new tests in `test_simple_transport_serialization.py` cover
  `MOZAIKS_MAX_WS_CONNECTIONS` default (500), env-override, invalid-env
  fallback, `MOZAIKS_WS_IDLE_TIMEOUT` default (360), env-override,
  zero-disables-detection, and `last_received_at` presence on connection
  registration. Brings `SimpleTransport` configuration paths to full
  unit-test coverage.

### Removed

- Removed the unreachable ValueEngine `save_build_plan` branch and the orphaned
  event-envelope guard that targeted a nonexistent schema directory.
- Retired `MozaiksContextExpression` / `evaluate_context_expression`. All
  workflow transition conditions now use AG2-native `ContextEquals` and
  `ToolCalled`, wrapped by `SourceScopedContextEquals` and
  `SourceScopedToolCalled` registered via `register_condition()`. The `${var}`
  expression syntax raises `WorkflowGraphCompileError` with a migration hint.
  The old `condition` string field also raises `WorkflowGraphCompileError` via
  a stale-field guard. A hygiene scan in `test_workflow_network_graph.py`
  prevents regressions across all factory workflow `transition_graph.yaml` files.
- Deleted `mozaiksai/core/workflow/execution/stream_bridge.py` — dead code
  (`_MozaiksStreamForwarder`, `attach_stream_forwarder`) with no runtime callers.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Packaged app-workspace coding-agent guidance as real `.md` files inside
  `mozaiks_cli/agent_guidance/` — included in the pip wheel. Rules and skill
  stubs for app-bundle, docs, frontend, modules, and workflows are no longer
  string literals in the init command.
- Mozaiks-managed guidance blocks are now automatically refreshed on
  `mozaiks serve` and `mozaiks studio` startup so builders get updated guidance
  after a package upgrade without running `mozaiks sync-agent-guidance` manually.
- Generated workspace scaffolds now include `app/config/secrets.yaml`
  (names-only secret contract with inline comments), `app/config/data.json`
  (canonical app data contract when needed), `app/config/data_migrations/`
  (additive migration artifacts), and `app/services/data/` helper lanes when
  needed.
- Generated workspace scaffolds now seed a complete `app/config/shell.json`
  with full navigation, chrome, and shortcuts blocks sourced from the factory
  app template — matching the layout the Studio shell expects on first run.

### Changed

- Generated `requirements.txt` now includes commented examples for
  app-specific dependencies (e.g. payment provider, Twilio) to clarify that `mozaiks`
  itself is not listed there — it is a platform-level install, not an
  app-level dependency.
- Getting Started doc clarified that `.\my-workspace` is the name of the
  folder created during quickstart; added a tip showing `--dir .` for users
  already inside their workspace directory.
- Getting Started doc updated to explain MongoDB as a required database with
  a Docker one-liner as the recommended local setup path.
- Updated contact email in `pyproject.toml`.

### Fixed

- Fixed MongoDB startup warning (`Index already exists with a different name:
  gc_ent_user_created`) that appeared on every server start. The persistence
  manager now performs a drop-then-create rename migration
  (`gc_ent_user_created` → `gc_app_user_created`,
  `gc_counter_ent_user` → `gc_counter_app_user`) instead of attempting a
  conflicting `create_index` call.
- Fixed Vite import resolution for `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`,
  `class-variance-authority`, `@radix-ui/*`, `marked`, `dompurify`, and
  `react-icons` when `mozaiks_chat_ui` is installed as a pip package. Added
  `resolve.alias` entries to `vite.config.js` matching the existing pattern
  for `react`, `lucide-react`, and `monaco-editor`.
- Added missing `chat-ui` peer dependencies (`clsx`, `tailwind-merge`,
  `class-variance-authority`, `@radix-ui/*`) to `web_shell/package.json` so
  the Studio frontend starts without Vite import errors on a fresh install.


## 0.1.6 - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Replaced the public first-run install path with `pip install mozaiks` followed
  by `python -m mozaiks ...`; the `mozaiks` command is documented as an optional
  shortcut only. Getting Started, README, and Local Setup updated accordingly.
- Standardized all public launch references around Studio:
  `python -m mozaiks studio --dir <workspace> --open`.
- Docs use tabbed contract snippets and collapsible troubleshooting blocks for
  cleaner navigation (Getting Started, Add Workflows, Add a Page).
- Runtime data integrity policy in Add a Module is now a visible warning block.

### Fixed

- Added `mozaiks/__init__.py` and `mozaiks/__main__.py` so `python -m mozaiks`
  works immediately after `pip install mozaiks` without a PATH refresh on any OS.
- Release CI smoke now verifies both `mozaiks --version` and
  `python -m mozaiks --version` from the installed wheel.
- MongoDB preflight added to Studio launcher: missing or unreachable MongoDB
  reports a clear diagnostic error instead of a generic backend startup failure.
- Corrected `open_console` → `open_studio` flag name in `quickstart` and
  `onboard` commands so `quickstart` reliably opens Studio on first run.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added brownfield app adoption continuation path. After `ExistingAppDiscovery`
  completes, the journey now advances to a `brownfield_path_selector` transition
  that routes into one of two downstream build sequences:
  - `brownfield_overlay_generation` (light integration): AgentGenerator → AppGenerator → app_review
  - `brownfield_module_generation` (full migration): DesignDocs → AgentGenerator → AppGenerator → app_review
- Added `BrownfieldPathSelector` transition component for the post-discovery
  build-path choice screen.
- Enabled the `brownfield_app` option in `AppTypeSelector` — existing-app
  onboarding is now a live, routable path from the `/create` entry point.
- Added `chat_session` transition type to the workflow routing system. A
  `chat_session` transition launches a target workflow in the current chat
  surface without a blocking overlay, allowing the user to interact
  conversationally. Declared with `route_to` only — `ui`, `options`,
  `confirm_route`, and `cancel_route` are not permitted.
- Added `AppReview` workflow: a lightweight AG2 session launched by the
  `app_review` chat_session transition after AppGenerator completes. ReviewAgent
  presents an `AppReviewSummary` in-chat artifact and manages the
  promote-or-revise HITL decision without blocking chat input.
- Added revision loop: when the user requests changes inside AppReview,
  `submit_revision_request` emits a `chat.revision_requested` WebSocket event
  carrying the request text. `ChatPage` handles the event by calling
  `POST /api/workflows/trigger` with `trigger_source="refinement"`, routing
  through the control plane into the appropriate revision workflow sequence
  (e.g. `app_surface_revision`) and switching the chat session in-place.
- Added build history page and carry-forward audit panel in the admin portal.
  Each artifact entry renders a `CarryForwardReportSummary`; the full panel is
  accessible at `/apps/:id/activity`.
- Added `promote_build` action to the `app_registry` module: validates
  `lifecycle_state == "review"`, transitions to `"active"`, and emits
  `domain.app_registry.app_promoted`.
- Added provider-neutral deployment artifact generation (`deployment_contract.py`):
  produces Dockerfile, CI workflow, and compose scaffold from the app bundle.
- Added `generated_bundle_scanner.py`: detects payment provider SDK usage, refund API
  calls, and secret key literals in generated bundles before promotion.
- Added canonical `ui/lib/moduleApi.js` template (`module_api_template.py`)
  with structured error fields for generated frontend module clients.
- Added AppGenerator shared-persistence contracts and adapter path support.
- Added conceptual-replan carry-forward smoke harness and saved fixture replay
  tests covering Levels A–E (inventory, context seed, AppBuildPlan,
  preservation, conflict resolution).
- Added Keycloak realm export and login theme assets under
  `factory_app/app/brand/`.

### Changed

- Changed `app_review` transition from `confirm` (blocking overlay using
  `AppReviewScreen`) to `chat_session` (launches `AppReview` workflow in-place).
  The review step now lives in the chat surface so users can type revision
  requests without modal interruption.
- Enforced single workflow root selection: the previous multi-root helper was
  replaced by `resolve_workflows_root()` (single `Path`).
- Renamed the context placeholder file to the context fallbacks file.
- Updated default control-plane LLM model from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-5-nano`.
- `subscriptions.yaml` now raises `ModuleLoadError` immediately on load;
  `ModuleLegacySubscriptionsManifest` removed.
- Simplified public setup around the installed `mozaiks` CLI via `pipx`,
  separating it from source checkout and standalone generated workspace setup.
- Clarified quickstart CLI output and generated workspace docs so `.venv`
  instructions are scoped to contributor repos or standalone app workspaces.

### Removed

- Removed `AppReviewScreen.js` transition overlay component — replaced by the
  `AppReviewSummary` agentic UI artifact in the `AppReview` workflow.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Added refinement control-plane smoke tooling, including the live classifier
  smoke harness, fixture replay coverage, and an offline dry-run refinement
  plan harness for safely previewing classification, routing, impact paths, and
  profile usage without running workflows or mutating app files.
- Added deterministic refinement impact mapping for ExperienceSpec UI surfaces,
  module/backend changes, hosted capability façade paths, external integration
  readiness, and data model migrations.
- Added conceptual-replan carry-forward tooling for module inventory,
  carry-forward candidate discovery, declarative contract reads, preservation
  resolution, AppGenerator carry-forward decisions, and carry-forward reporting.
- Added artifact content-store support and workflow artifact persistence
  hardening so generated app and workflow bundles can be restored, reviewed,
  invalidated, and promoted more reliably.

### Changed

- Promoted `experience_spec` to a first-class artifact dependency family and
  aligned staleness propagation, routing docs, sequence impact families, and
  downstream UI path hints with that contract.
- Moved control-plane LLM configuration to named profile resolution for
  classifier, impact analysis, planning/replanning, codegen, review/validation,
  and architecture-level planning.
- Updated public contributor guidance, MkDocs navigation, control-plane docs,
  and task skills for workflow-sequence-driven refinement and factory workflow
  contribution boundaries.

### Fixed

- **CI regression after refinement profile changes**: Allowed the declared
  `architecture` control-plane LLM profile, aligned ExperienceSpec dependency
  assertions, removed provider-specific refinement examples, and updated
  responsive smoke expectations for the current Usage UI.
- **Stuck REVISING state**: Added `SessionRouter.fail_active_revision()` to
  clear `active_revision_id` and set `sequence_status=STALE` when a workflow
  errors during a revision. `handle_user_input_from_api` now calls it via
  `asyncio.create_task()` in its exception handler, preventing the session from
  remaining stuck in REVISING indefinitely.
- **Migration schema mismatch**: `generate_migration()` in
  `factory_app/workflows/AppGenerator/tools/schema_migration.py` now emits the
  `schema_version` and `operations[]` fields required by the runtime
  `_validate_migration()` check. New collections are represented as
  `ensure_collection` operations. Generator output now survives a full
  generate → inject → load → validate roundtrip without raising
  `DatabaseMigrationError`.
- **Permission bypass**: `mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py` now passes
  `granted_permissions=list(principal.scopes)` (instead of `None`) when
  dispatching module actions for authenticated HTTP requests. `granted_permissions=None`
  is preserved only for trusted-internal (unauthenticated) calls. Module-level
  `action_permissions` declared in `module.yaml` are now correctly enforced for
  OAuth2-authenticated principals.
- **DRAFT artifact leaks**: `resolve_latest_artifact_version_refs()` now
  filters by `lifecycle_status=CURRENT` when resolving canonical input version
  IDs. DRAFT versions (created during in-flight revisions) can no longer
  contaminate the `canonical_inputs_version` of downstream artifacts.
  The parent-version lookup in `persist_summary_artifact()` also filters by
  CURRENT to avoid linking new artifacts to an in-flight DRAFT parent.
- **First-run canonical inputs**: When no CURRENT artifact version exists for
  a requested kind (first run or all versions still in DRAFT/STALE state),
  `resolve_latest_artifact_version_refs()` now logs a DEBUG message and
  correctly returns that kind absent from the result dict rather than silently
  returning a stale or draft version ID.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Added the generated-app persistence runtime path, including `ctx.persistence`,
  `MongoPersistenceContext`, `database_intent` loading, additive migrations,
  and database index application.
- Added migration startup policy, migration history/locking, migration health
  reporting, and the read-only `mozaiks migrations status` CLI.
- Added AppGenerator persistence alignment so generated persistent modules use
  canonical `repo.py`, `schemas.py`, `policy.py`, database intent, and staged
  migration artifacts.
- `ExistingAppDiscovery` workflow now detects storage patterns (mongodb, sql, file_store, redis), external connectors, and Mozaiks vocabulary/authorship signals during preload — improving adoption-level recommendations for `native_migration` and `ecosystem` paths.
- Added `ModuleDecomposerAgent` to `ExistingAppDiscovery`: produces a `ModuleDecompositionPlan` (modules, workflows, pages, adapters) when adoption level is `ecosystem` or `native_migration`.
- `ExistingAppAugmentationArtifact` now carries `module_decomposition_plan` (serialized JSON); `save_existing_app_artifacts` writes the plan to `generated/existing_app_discovery/{chat_id}/` for downstream AppGenerator consumption.
- `transition_graph.yaml` now routes conditionally: `ecosystem`/`native_migration` goes through `ModuleDecomposerAgent` before the assembler; `embed`/`bridge` skip directly to assembly.
- Added three generic infrastructure probe adapters to `mozaiksai/core/adapters/`: `dns_probe` (A/AAAA via stdlib, MX/NS/CNAME/TXT via optional dnspython), `tls_probe` (cert expiry, SANs, issuer, protocol via stdlib ssl), and `http_health` (status, latency, redirect chain, content metadata via httpx). All are provider-neutral with no required credentials.

### Changed

- Hardened generated-app persistence docs/tests and documented production
  `required` startup mode.
- Hardened UI/design-system contracts, shared workflow infrastructure, and
  route/docs alignment for the OSS factory Studio.
- `IntegrationPlannerAgent` no longer defaults to embed/bridge — prefers `native_migration` when `mozaiks_authored_app` is true, storage is file_store, or app is internal tooling.
- Tightened generated UI quality-gate enforcement for custom React surfaces: docs/tests fixture paths are ignored, semantic token/class usage is covered by dedicated tests, and AppGenerator guidance now explicitly requires semantic Button variants backed by `app/brand/theme_config.json` and shared primitives.
- Aligned OSS frontend architecture docs, frontend rules, and add-page skill guidance with the generated UI gate: semantic tokens/variants are allowed, hardcoded hex/rgb and direct font-family styling are disallowed, local primitive clones and raw primary buttons are disallowed, and docs/tests fixture paths are excluded from generated React audit scope.
- Moved the shared generated UI gate into `factory_app/workflows/_shared/` and documented the boundary between factory-owned shared workflow infrastructure and generated workflow-local files.
- Moved shared platform build lifecycle hooks into `factory_app/workflows/_shared/platform/` and documented the canonical placement rules for factory-owned shared workflow infrastructure versus workflow-local generated files.
- Updated public contributor docs, setup skills, env/web-shell guidance, and .claude rules to frame `factory_app` as the first-party builder/reference workspace, describe build as workflow-sequence-driven, and document refinement as checkpoint/control-plane re-entry rather than a dedicated workflow.
- Unified the module event-reaction contract on canonical `contracts/reactions.yaml` across runtime loading/routing, AppGenerator prompts and structured outputs, CLI scaffolds, contributor guidance, and contract tests.
- Consolidated source-of-truth architecture docs and module-authoring guidance for the canonical event/reaction model, including provider-neutral `tasks` examples and explicit rejection of `contracts/subscriptions.yaml`.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Consolidated first-party Studio ownership under `factory_app/app/admin/pages/` and `factory_app/app/admin/index.js`.
- Updated workspace Studio navigation to derive from route-manifest metadata (`meta.navigation.group`, `meta.navigation.icon`) instead of hardcoded sidebar arrays in `WorkspaceLayout`.
- Aligned route manifest contracts so workspace and app Studio routes declare explicit navigation inclusion/grouping semantics.

### Fixed

- Fixed active admin portal page imports to resolve shared `StudioShared` primitives from the canonical `factory_app/app/ui/components/` location.
- Regenerated packaging manifest metadata (`mozaiks.egg-info/SOURCES.txt`) to match the current Studio files.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Standardized generated app scaffolds from `mozaiks init` with app-local `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, README, PowerShell launch scripts, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.claude` rules/skills for coding agents.
- Added Claude release-notes rules and skill guidance so release-impacting changes update this changelog proactively.
- Added `mozaiks sync-agent-guidance` to safely check, create, or update generated coding-agent guidance in existing app workspaces.
- Added AppGenerator UI primitive catalog injection, generated UI quality gates, and generated UI acceptance coverage so agents target shipped primitives instead of hallucinated UI components.
- Added module-contract quality checks and canonical module contract guidance for generated modules.
- Added Studio/app management UX surfaces for app portfolio management, shell actions, notifications, and generated app lifecycle visibility.

### Changed

- Updated OSS setup docs to distinguish public package usage, source checkout dogfooding, and framework development.
- Reorganized public architecture docs around app, module system, workflows, frontend UI, builder, and MozaiksAI runtime sections.
- Updated factory app UI primitives, shell branding, and Studio copy toward the production-grade app-management model.
- Aligned AppGenerator prompts, hooks, and structured-output guidance with the canonical module and generated UI contracts.

### Fixed

- Fixed PyPI project description media by using absolute GitHub asset URLs for the README logo and demo images.
- Fixed primitive catalog hook section replacement so injected guidance no longer truncates later agent instructions.
- Fixed primitive loader test isolation by exposing cache invalidation for cached UI primitive exports.

### Removed

- Removed stale public telemetry walkthroughs, old roadmap/spec docs, and duplicate prompt-pack docs that no longer match the canonical product and generator model.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Initial public PyPI release of the Mozaiks OSS framework.
- Packaged CLI entrypoint with `mozaiks --version`.
- Tag-driven GitHub Actions release flow for building, smoke-testing, creating a GitHub release, and publishing to PyPI.

- Preserve untouched app files during partial AppGenerator revisions using the
  selected artifact's verified archive as the baseline for agents and assembly.
