# Internal Messaging

Internal messaging is the app-owned conversation substrate for user-to-user,
operator-to-user, and support-desk threads. It is not an external integration.
External providers such as email, SMS, push, or chat tools are delivery
adapters that can react to message events later.

## Ownership

| Layer | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `messages` module | Threads, messages, read state, conversation scope, recipient fan-out events. |
| `workspace_support` module | First-party Studio support tickets, ticket status, severity, page context, feedback. |
| `support` build-context pack | Generated app support request metadata and support inbox pages. |
| `social` build-context pack | Optional friends, follows, invitations, posts, comments, reactions, and activity feed records. |
| Platform notifications | In-app notification persistence and notification center visibility. |
| Integration modules | Optional external delivery through provider-specific adapters. |

This separation keeps support from becoming a second chat system. Support
records reference `message_thread_id`; the conversation itself lives in the
`messages` module.

## Active Studio Modules

factory_app/app/modules/messages/
factory_app/app/modules/workspace_support/
```

`messages` exposes:

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `create_thread` | Create a `group`, `direct`, or `support` thread. |
| `list_threads` | List threads for the current participant. |
| `get_thread` | Fetch a thread and messages. |
| `send_message` | Persist a message and emit recipient notification facts. |
| `mark_thread_read` | Store read state for the current user. |

Message threads carry:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `scope_type` | `app` for app-owned conversations, `workspace` for workspace/user social conversations. |
| `scope_id` | The app id or workspace id for the selected scope. |
| `subject_app_id` | The app the conversation is about. Support threads should set this even when Studio stores the record in a management persistence scope. |

`workspace_support` creates and links a support thread when a support request
is submitted. Operator replies call `MessageService.send_message()` with the
ticket owner as the recipient. The support module still emits
`domain.workspace_support.message_added` for audit and support-specific
automation, but user notification is owned by `domain.messages.message_sent`.

Generated apps selecting the `support` pack also select `messaging`. Their
`support.create_support_request` action creates the ticket's messages thread
and first message on the server, then stores the thread id with ticket metadata.
The Support page uses `support.get_support_conversation` and
`support.reply_support_request`; the service checks requester ownership or
support read/manage permission before delegating to `MessageService`. The
generated public messages actions serve direct and group conversations only.
They cannot create, list, read, or send support threads, even when the caller
has generic messaging permission. This keeps the ticket as the authority for
support conversation access. Support request records store the subject and
page context, while message bodies stay only in the messages collection.

Support status is explicit:

- `open` means the ticket can still receive replies.
- `resolved` means the ticket is closed; the linked message thread is also
  marked resolved and the composer should be hidden until the ticket is
  reopened.
- "Needs reply" is derived UI state for open tickets where the latest support
  message came from the user or assistant transcript.
- "Responded" is derived UI state for open tickets where the latest support
  message came from an operator. Sending a reply does not resolve the ticket.

## Events And Notifications

`messages/contracts/events.yaml` declares:

- `domain.messages.thread_created`
- `domain.messages.message_sent`
- `domain.messages.thread_read`

`messages/contracts/notifications.yaml` uses `recipient_ids` from
`domain.messages.message_sent` to create in-app notifications. This is the
canonical path for "operator replied" notifications.

`workspace_support/contracts/notifications.yaml` owns support-queue alerts that
are not plain message-recipient delivery: new support requests, ticket-owner
replies, and negative feedback. These rules target principals with
`workspace_support.read`, so a user who is also an admin can see operator alerts
when their active principal has that scope. The profile support page remains
user-scoped by default and lists only the current user's tickets, including
resolved tickets. Admin/support queues must request `scope=app` or
`scope=workspace` and carry support read or manage permission. Support actions
require an authenticated caller when auth is enabled; the service checks ticket
ownership for user replies and mutations. Hosted products grant operator
permissions through their own validated identity policy. The Studio queue routes
also require the `admin` role for navigation, but that role alone does not grant
the module's read or manage permission. An OIDC operator token needs those
permissions from its identity policy or a host-owned permission resolver.

The `subject_app_id` action input identifies the app a request or feedback item
is about, or filters an operator queue. It does not change the authenticated
runtime `app_id` or persistence scope. Support clients send their access token
with module actions. A failed ticket insert or list read is surfaced as an
error, so the UI does not claim that an unsaved ticket exists or show an
unavailable queue as empty.
Generic message lookups and mutations resolve `thread_id` inside the caller's
current app or workspace scope before loading messages, updating the thread, or
writing read state. A matching participant id alone is not enough to read or
mutate a conversation from another app/workspace scope.
The workspace scope is the caller's verified workspace: the workspace the
validated token is bound to, or a membership a host scope hook verified
(`verified_workspace_id`). A workspace named by the request (`scope_id`, the
dispatch context or the query string) never selects it, and a signed-in caller
with no verified workspace cannot create, list or open workspace threads. Local
development (authentication off, development access) keeps using the dispatch
workspace.
The profile support panel groups tickets by `subject_app_id`, keeping the
authenticated runtime `app_id` separate from the app the ticket concerns. If a
listed ticket has no accessible linked message thread, its `error` field tells
the profile and operator panels to show the failure and withhold the reply
control. Clients do not submit `sender_role`; the authenticated module derives
the role from server-side authority.
Profile page hydration resolves module scope through the same host hook as
HTTP module actions, so hosted membership can supply workspace scope and
permissions when they are absent from the login token.

Escalation UI should create a support request and navigate users to
`/me?tab=support-tickets`, optionally with `request_id` and `app_id` query
parameters. It should not send users to a generic `/support` route, because the
profile support tab is the durable user-facing transcript surface.

## Persistence

The `messages` module uses `ctx.persistence.collection()`:

| Entity | Collection |
| --- | --- |
| Threads | `messages`, `threads` |
| Messages | `messages`, `messages` |
| Read state | `messages`, `thread_reads` |

Support tickets stay under:

| Entity | Collection |
| --- | --- |
| Requests | `workspace_support`, `requests` |
| Feedback | `workspace_support`, `feedback` |

Generated social or support-heavy apps should reuse this contract instead of
creating module-local message arrays, support-only transcript collections, or
provider-specific chat stores.

## Modular Selection

- Select `messaging` when the app needs persisted conversations.
- Select `support` when the app needs a help desk, support inbox, or operator
  replies. `support` requires `messaging`.
- Select `social` when the app needs friends, follows, invitations, user posts,
  comments, reactions, or activity feeds.
- Keep governance features such as proposals, votes, quorum, moderation policy,
  and treasury/decision logic app-specific until there is a reusable governance
  pack. They can reference `messages` for deliberation threads, but they should
  not be generated as default social or support behavior.

Support is app-scoped. Social graph and DMs are not automatically app-scoped:
apps that need workspace-level social behavior should use `scope_type=workspace`
for message threads and keep social graph ownership in the `social` pack.

## Hosted Product Extensions

Hosted product workspaces such as `mozaiks-app` consume this substrate instead
of forking it. Hosted modules may add product policy, announcement surfaces,
operator routing, realtime fan-out, moderation, billing, marketplace, or
community-specific behavior, but the durable conversation state remains:

- `messages` owns threads, message bodies, participants, read state, and
  `domain.messages.*` lifecycle events.
- support modules own ticket metadata and reference `message_thread_id` instead
  of copying transcripts into a second store.
- social modules own friends, follows, invitations, posts, and feed records.
- notification modules consume declared events; they do not become message or
  support persistence.

Contacts are not a messaging primitive. A hosted or generated app should only
keep a `contacts` module if it has explicit private-address-book semantics that
are distinct from friends, follows, or workspace membership. A DM picker roster
should be backed by `social` relationships or a dedicated relationship provider,
not `messaging.contacts.*` capabilities.

Governance remains product-specific until there is a dedicated reusable pack.
Hosted community governance should use `hosted.*` events for proposal, voting,
quorum, treasury, moderation, and revenue-policy lifecycle. A future OSS
governance pack should be smaller and generic, such as proposals and decisions,
and may reference `messages` for deliberation threads.

## External Delivery

In-app notifications are the default OSS delivery path. Email, SMS, push, and
workspace chat providers should be added as integration-backed delivery
adapters that subscribe to `domain.messages.message_sent` and respect the same
recipient facts. Those adapters should not own thread or message persistence.

## Debugging Support Escalation

Use these log filters when verifying widget-to-profile support flows:

- Browser console: `[mozaiks-support]` for widget escalation and request creation.
- Browser console: `[mozaiks-profile]` for `/me` tab hydration and active tab sync.
- Browser console: `[mozaiks-support-panel]` for profile support ticket selection and replies.
- Backend logs: `workspace_support:` for request metadata, thread linkage, and support-message hydration.
- Backend logs: `messages:` for thread creation, message persistence, and recipient fan-out.

The profile URL may carry `app_id` as subject context, but profile panel
hydration must remain bound to the active runtime app. `/api/me/profile-panels`
passes that `app_id` to module actions as contextual input instead of using it
as the module execution persistence scope.
