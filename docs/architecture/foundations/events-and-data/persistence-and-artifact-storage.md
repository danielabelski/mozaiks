# Persistence and Artifact Storage

Mozaiks is a framework with a durable build pipeline, not a stateless prompt
wrapper. Persistent storage is therefore a first-class runtime contract.

## Core Rule

- Durable persistence is required for Studio and the
  workflow-owned build sequence,
  `factory_app`, multi-stage build workflows, refinement, and revision history.
- In-memory execution is only acceptable for smoke tests, demos, or simple
  non-builder workflows that do not need upstream artifacts.
- MongoDB is the canonical persistence backend today.

## Ownership Layers

Mozaiks persistence is divided into three scopes.

### 1. Runtime State

Framework-owned operational data used by the runtime itself:

- `ChatSessions`
- `AG2StreamEvents`
- `AG2StreamHeads`
- `GeneralChatSessions`
- `GeneralChatCounters`
- `RuntimeUsageEvents`

This data supports session continuity, workflow execution state, AG2 stream
bootstrap/replay, and reconnectable UI state.

Current implemented workflow-run persistence contract:

- `ChatSessions` is run metadata and UI-state projection, not canonical execution history.
- Its `WorkflowStatus` is `0` (in progress, including pauses), `1` (completed),
  or `2` (failed). Failure writes `failed_at`, duration, and a session-version
  increment before failure hooks or terminal UI delivery, and clears pending
  input without discarding artifacts. A terminal status cannot be overwritten
  by another outcome. Only completed sessions satisfy workflow prerequisites.
- Failed sessions reject websocket reconnection and execution input. Both
  completed and failed sessions reject direct orchestration re-entry. Pauses,
  admission denials, lease loss, and cancellation do not mark a session failed.
  Retrying a failed workflow requires a new session, not replay of that run.
- A closed chat-scoped AG2 channel also blocks opening a replacement channel,
  even for older session projections left at `0`. This uses AG2's existing WAL,
  not Factory build receipts or a second runtime state store. A receipt-only
  historical failure with no terminal AG2 state cannot be inferred generically;
  this change does not migrate historical records or inspect product outcomes.
- AG2 run history is persisted separately through the AG2 stream storage adapters and is the source of truth for execution re-entry and UI replay.
- While the backend process still owns a paused AG2 workflow channel, user
  replies continue that live AG2 channel first. Persisted AG2 events are the
  canonical replay and restart fallback when the live Hub/channel handle is no
  longer available.
- AG2 agent-turn, LLM-call, tool-call, and HITL telemetry is emitted through AG2
  beta `TelemetryMiddleware` as OpenTelemetry spans.
- LLM token usage is emitted by Mozaiks AG2 1.0 usage middleware as
  `chat.usage_delta` events and stored in `RuntimeUsageEvents`. This ledger is
  measurement-only. It does not enforce entitlements, quotas, pricing, or
  hosted billing.
- Reconnectable workflow UI state lives under `ChatSessions.workflow_ui_state` with:
  - `schema_version`
  - `last_artifact`
  - `pending_input_request`
  - `tool_calls`
- On startup, the runtime backfills pre-migration top-level workflow UI fields such as `last_artifact` and `pending_input_request` into `workflow_ui_state` and removes the old top-level fields. Runtime readers should not depend on those pre-migration top-level fields.
- The current source of truth for this runtime contract is `mozaiksai/core/data/persistence/persistence_manager.py`, `mozaiksai/core/workflow/execution/run_bootstrap.py`, `mozaiksai/core/transport/run_replay.py`, `mozaiksai/hosts/runtime.py`, `mozaiksai/hosts/platform.py`, and the focused tests `tests/test_persistence_initial_messages.py`, `tests/test_orchestration_seed_persistence.py`, `tests/test_run_replay.py`, `tests/test_runtime_websocket_contract.py`, and `tests/test_platform_chat_meta_contract.py`.

Runtime usage surfaces:

- OSS app creators query `/api/admin/usage` in Studio/Admin for app-scoped or
  workspace-scoped token totals.
- Hosted products such as Mozaiks App use the same `/api/admin/usage` route and
  may also forward summary events to their Refinement Engine.
- Generated app end users query `/api/me/usage` from the profile surface. The
  response combines measured runtime usage with usage-limit metadata declared
  in `app/config/subscriptions.yaml` when the app is a SaaS app.
- MozaiksPay and other billing providers consume these measurements through
  app-owned facade modules. Runtime usage events are not the billing authority.

### 2. Builder Artifacts

Framework-owned pipeline artifacts produced and consumed by `factory_app`:

- `BuilderConcepts`
- `BuilderBuildPlans`
- `DesignDocuments`
- `ThemeCaptures`
- `DataContracts`
- `DatabaseMigrations`
- `WorkflowExports`
- `LLMConfig`

These collections hold the durable handoff between workflow stages such as
`ValueEngine`, `DesignDocs`, `AgentGenerator`, and `AppGenerator`.

Versioned `BuildRecord` documents in `ArtifactVersions` use the unique key
`(app_id, build_family, build_key, version_number)`. Counters in
`ArtifactVersionCounters` use `(app_id, build_family, build_key)`. Store
initialization installs these indexes for canonical records and removes only
the known obsolete unique indexes over `artifact_kind` and `artifact_key`.
Existing documents are not deleted or rewritten. An unexpected index definition
or conflicting canonical data fails initialization and requires operator review.

### 2b. Platform Connector Metadata

Platform-owned, app-scoped connector metadata used by the visible
Integrations/Admin surfaces and workflow integration helpers:

- `AppConnectors`

This collection stores sanitized connector state only. Raw API keys, OAuth
client secrets, refresh tokens, and other secrets do not belong in MongoDB
builder artifacts.

### 2c. Connector Secret Vault

Durable connector secrets are a separate framework-owned backend:

- default contract: `mozaiksai.core.secrets.connector_vault`
- default provider mode: `MOZAIKS_CONNECTOR_SECRET_BACKEND=auto`

Backends selected by `auto`:

| Condition | Backend |
| --- | --- |
| `AZURE_KEY_VAULT_NAME` is set | `AzureKeyVaultConnectorVaultBackend` |
| No Azure vault configured | `MongoConnectorVaultBackend` (default) |

`MongoConnectorVaultBackend` stores Fernet-encrypted secrets in the `ConnectorSecrets`
collection in the same MongoDB instance. Encryption key priority:

1. `MOZAIKS_CONNECTOR_SECRET_KEY` — explicit 32-byte URL-safe base64 or hex key
2. Derived via HMAC-SHA256 from `SECRET_KEY`
3. Dev-only deterministic fallback with a loud warning (not for production)

To generate an explicit key:
```
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

Rules:

- MongoDB (`Connectors` collection) stores connector metadata, status, timestamps,
  and ownership only — never raw secrets.
- `ConnectorSecrets` collection stores encrypted secret values managed by
  `MongoConnectorVaultBackend`. Each record is uniquely keyed by
  `(scope, scope_id, normalized_service)` where `scope` is `app` or `workspace`.
  These are framework-internal records, not app data.
- Azure secret names include the scope kind and a digest of the complete connector
  identity. Reads verify the returned identity tags before releasing a value.
- The vault backend requires an explicit scope on every save, read, and delete.
  Unqualified older records are never used as a fallback.
- Before upgrading an environment with saved connectors, run the private
  metadata-only inventory described in the workspace integration guide. Old
  records need operator review; ambiguous records need credential re-entry.
- Azure Key Vault remains the recommended backend for production deployments that
  already operate Key Vault infrastructure.
- A connector is `active` when `secret_available: true` (secret stored in vault).
  It is `metadata_only` only when the save itself failed — not simply because no
  external vault is configured. Legacy secret metadata does not count as ready
  after the scoped vault contract is installed.

### 3. App Business Data

App-owned product data managed by generated or hosted modules:

- projects
- tasks
- audit_logs
- notifications
- other module-owned collections

This data is not builder metadata. It belongs to app module boundaries and must
be declared by the app's backend contracts.

## Canonical Namespace

Framework-owned persistence uses a single system database:

- database: `mozaiksai`

Active code should not introduce hardcoded framework database names outside the
canonical `mozaiksai` namespace. Older local database names are not part of the
clean OSS contract.

## Builder Artifact Flow

The build pipeline depends on durable artifact handoff:

1. `ValueEngine` writes concept and planning artifacts.
2. `DesignDocs` reads those artifacts and writes design contracts.
3. `AgentGenerator` and `AppGenerator` read the design artifacts.
4. Refinement and revision flows read prior versions and migration history.

This is why persistence is required for the real builder experience.

## Staged Filesystem Output

Generated app bundles are staged on disk under:

`generated/apps/{app_id}/{build_id}/app`

That staged bundle is separate from Mongo persistence:

- Mongo stores build/runtime metadata and durable workflow handoff artifacts.
- the filesystem stores the generated app bundle itself.

Promotion into a runnable workspace is an explicit later step.

## Data Contracts and Revisions

Database evolution is a first-class generated artifact, not an implicit side
effect of handler code.

- `DesignDocs` owns the typed `data_contract`
- `AppGenerator` stages `data/contract.json`
- Refinement Runs may stage `data/migrations/{migration_id}.json`
- generated module repos use `backend/schemas.py` for typed document shapes and
  `backend/repo.py` for persistence operations
- the runtime injects `ctx.persistence` into module actions when `app_id` exists;
  generated repo code uses `ctx.persistence.collection(module_id, collection_name)`
  and must not require `ctx.db`
- the runtime loads `data/contract.json` during app load; missing
  intent is allowed for non-persistent apps, while invalid JSON or invalid shape
  fails app loading
- the runtime applies and rereads declared indexes idempotently, reports
  readiness only after exact materialized verification, and applies only
  additive migration files from `data/migrations/*.json`
- migration states are recorded in `mozaiksai.AppDatabaseMigrations`

For collections declaring `per_user` or `per_workspace` tenancy and an
`owner_field`, runtime persistence applies the authenticated principal's user or
workspace identity to every read, count, update, delete, and aggregation. Inserts
receive that exact owner field automatically; a supplied conflicting value is
rejected. Updates cannot move a row to another owner. This boundary covers both
generated canonical actions and model-authored repositories without relying on
their filters or use of `policy.py`.

The runtime captures the token-validated HTTP or socket principal; Page Ask
dispatch carries the same immutable identity. A registered host
`module_scope_resolver` can return `verified_workspace_id` only after verifying
membership for that authenticated actor. Omission preserves the signed token's
workspace claim; explicit `None` revokes workspace ownership. Plain
`workspace_id`, action inputs, requested scope, and mutable context fields never
grant ownership. The assertion is accepted only from the registered host hook.
The hook's `verified_tenant_id` assertion keys module entitlement lookups only;
persistence never reads it, and stored rows keep the dispatch tenant.

Auth-disabled local, development, and test hosts use an explicit logged
development principal with stable workspace `development`. This authority is
unavailable in deployed environments. Generated apps with any `per_user` or
`per_workspace` collection deterministically set `app.json.authRequired=true`
and receive the canonical auth scaffold, even when model-authored app intent
omits auth or requests a public app.

Module execution binds and revokes ownership authority around each dispatch.
Each collection operation uses that active principal, so a cached handle cannot
retain an earlier caller's ownership. Expired scopes and cached handles used
from another app fail closed. Host-created standalone persistence contexts may
supply an explicit principal for host operations. `app_wide` and ownerless
collections receive no additional owner filter.

Repos call `ctx.persistence.collection(module_id, collection_name)` using the
declared collection `name`. A declared `entity` value resolves to the same
physical collection and ownership policy; unknown references fail closed.
A filter that repeats the principal's own owner or app identity adds no
condition and is not matched twice, so owned upserts may name the owner field.

Platform modules a host mounts into a workspace, such as Studio's built-in
modules, are bound by their own bundle's `data/contract.json` rather than the
workspace's. Each dispatch's persistence is composed for the dispatching module:
app modules keep the workspace contract and cannot reach platform collections,
and a platform module reaches only the collections declared for it. See
[Data Contracts](../../app/data-contracts.md#platform-modules-mounted-into-a-workspace).

Aggregations operate on the caller's owned rows. Foreign-collection stages and
aggregation writes cannot bypass the boundary, and admin permissions do not
implicitly disable it. Cross-owner behavior is unavailable through module
persistence until an explicitly declared, auditable runtime access contract is
implemented. Generated code must not substitute raw Mongo access.
In mixed apps, literal access to an owned physical collection is rejected.
Unowned aliases remain usable through a bounded Mongo-compatible facade that
supports their existing operations and safe aggregation cursors; it prevents
foreign-collection stages and database introspection from exposing owned rows.
Each method binds its call against the installed driver's contract for that
operation: primary arguments (filter, update, document, pipeline and so on) by
position or by the driver's keyword but not both, plus only the options the
driver defines for that operation (such as sessions, comments, sorts, upserts,
index hints, time limits, `skip`/`limit` for counts, and
`allowDiskUse`/`batchSize` for aggregations). Any other option, a surplus
positional argument, or a raw query command envelope in a read filter is refused
before the driver builds a command. An aggregation pipeline, on this facade and
on owner-scoped collections, is copied once into plain documents, and that copy
is both what the stage validator checks and what the driver sends.
Bounded handles keep a module's mistakes inside its own collections; they are
not a sandbox against hostile code running in the host process, which can reach
the database by other means.
Apps with no owned collections retain raw alias behavior. Scoped shared
collections must declare their owning surface; missing ownership fails loading.
Index changes on owned collections remain host startup work: module calls cannot
create collection-wide indexes, including TTL indexes that delete other owners' rows.

Generated-module admission rejects private persistence attributes, raw driver
imports, client/context constructors, and request-principal binding internals,
including ordinary aliases. Generated modules resolve declared aliases through
`app_data_from_context(ctx)`, without overriding its contract or app root;
direct `literal_collection` calls and constructing `AppData` are rejected.
Startup declarations grant no raw-driver or ownership exemption; generated
workers follow the same module admission rules. Provider database SDK mechanics
belong in declared `services/adapters/database/` integrations, which cannot own
app persistence authority. Account-data handlers receive their
database through the account-data protocol and have no raw-client exemption.

The target contract is:

- additive changes can be applied deterministically
- destructive changes require explicit review
- migration history must stay linked to app artifact versions

Supported generated app migration operations today are:

- `ensure_collection`
- `ensure_index`

The runtime does not execute arbitrary migration code, drop collections, delete
fields, rename fields, or rewrite documents as part of generated app migrations.

Generated-app database startup policy is controlled by
`MOZAIKS_DATABASE_STARTUP_POLICY`:

- `best_effort` is the default for additive migrations. Migration failures are
  logged and startup continues.
- declared index inspection, mismatch, creation, or verification failures
  always fail startup; an app cannot report healthy against an incompatible
  persistence contract.
- `required` is recommended for production persistent generated apps so
  migration failures also fail startup.

Apps with no `data/contract.json`, with no declared indexes, or running locally
under `best_effort` without a configured Mongo connection keep the
non-persistent startup path and do not require Mongo index readiness. A Mongo
connection, `required` policy, or production environment enables the readiness
gate.
Index comparison uses names, ordered keys, and all canonical materialized
options. Runtime application is additive only and never drops an index;
definition changes require an explicit operator compatibility migration.

App business data database names are resolved from an injected adapter value,
then `MOZAIKS_APP_DATABASE_NAME`, then `MOZAIKS_APPS_DATABASE`, then
`mozaiks_apps`.

Account export and deletion dispatch registered module `AccountDataHandler`
implementations through the platform's `/api/account/export` and `/api/account`
routes. The routes use the authenticated principal's app and user identity and
the existing app-data database accessor; they do not read the workflow runtime's
persistence manager. App-data alias consumers additionally honor
`MOZAIKS_APP_DATA_DATABASE_NAME` before the app database settings above. Handlers
resolve their own collection contracts and enforce app/user ownership. Factory's
onboarding module exercises this path with canonical generated collection names;
an alias manifest is not required merely to resolve the account database.

For a module owning `per_user` collections, code renders
`backend/account_data_handler.py` from the data contract. Its constructor takes
`persistence`: the account routes build the requesting account's
`MongoPersistenceContext` from the loaded app's data contract
(`app.state.data_contract`) and the authenticated principal, so every export and
delete query is app- and owner-scoped by the runtime exactly like a module
action's `ctx.persistence`, and the handler also filters by the owner field.
Handlers whose constructor takes `db` still receive the app database. For any
other module declaring `user_data_scope`, AppGenerator's ServiceAgent owns the
handler; the materializer preserves its `ServiceOutput.python_files` content,
rather than generating a deletion policy from module stubs. The existing account-data file
contract and hook supply raw Motor API guidance and the current
`mozaiksai.core.runtime.persistence.naming.collection_name_for` signature.
For a repo using `ctx.persistence.collection(module_id, collection_name)`, the handler
must use those same IDs with `collection_name_for(app_id=app_id, ...)` and omit
`app_slug`, matching the standard executor. Literal collections, aliases,
external bindings, and custom contexts retain their declared storage contract;
the generated-name helper is not a universal alias resolver.

Raw database access does not inject scope: deletion and export queries must
include app identity and the user's ownership fields, even in an app-specific
physical collection. Preserve the module's existing deletion or anonymization
policy. Account exports must also be JSON-safe before reaching `JSONResponse`:
exclude storage `_id` or stringify ObjectId values, and encode datetimes as
ISO 8601 strings, including nested values. The contract's export example is
tested against real BSON values and JSON serialization; this verifies guidance
and materialization, not arbitrary model-generated implementations.

Migration history records use `in_progress`, `applied`, and `failed`. The
`mozaiksai.AppDatabaseMigrations` collection also acts as the migration lock:
the runtime atomically claims a migration by inserting an `in_progress` record
for `(app_id, migration_id)` before operations run. The collection has a unique
index on `(app_id, migration_id)` so concurrent startup instances cannot both
claim the same migration.

Failed records include error type/message and failed operation details. Existing
`in_progress` or `failed` records block automatic retry until an operator clears
or repairs the history record. `in_progress` means another instance is applying
the migration or a previous instance crashed after claiming it. The first-pass
runtime does not take over expired locks; operators must inspect the history
record and repair or clear it deliberately. Production persistent apps should
run with `MOZAIKS_DATABASE_STARTUP_POLICY=required` so migration lock conflicts
fail startup instead of being treated as healthy.

Migration health is inspectable through the read-only runtime helper
`get_migration_health_report()`. The report returns summary counts, migration
items, `has_blockers`, and `has_unknown_statuses`. `failed` and `in_progress`
records are operational blockers; `applied` records are healthy; unknown
statuses are surfaced for operator review. The helper does not repair, clear,
retry, or mutate migration records. Operators should inspect this report when
startup logs or required-mode startup failures mention migration application or
claim failures.

The CLI exposes the same read-only report:

```powershell
mozaiks migrations status --app-id app_123
mozaiks migrations status --status failed --json
```

Options:

- `--app-id`: filter to one app.
- `--status`: filter to one migration status.
- `--limit`: maximum rows, default `100`.
- `--database-name`: migration history database override for diagnostics.
- `--json`: print the exact report as JSON.

Exit codes:

- `0`: no blockers and no unknown statuses.
- `1`: failed/in-progress blockers or unknown statuses exist.
- `2`: configuration, Mongo connection, or report loading error.

The command does not print Mongo connection strings or credentials. It does not
repair, clear, retry, mutate migration records, or take over locks.

### Real Mongo Smoke

Normal CI does not require MongoDB for generated-app persistence. The real
Mongo-backed smoke is opt-in and validates the production adapter path:

```powershell
$env:MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017"
$env:MOZAIKS_RUN_REAL_MONGO_TESTS="1"
python -m pytest tests/test_runtime_persistence_real_mongo.py
```

The smoke creates a dedicated test app database named
`mozaiks_persistence_test_{random}` by default and drops it during cleanup. To
use an explicit test database name, set `MOZAIKS_TEST_APP_DATABASE_NAME` to a
dedicated database whose name contains `test`. Do not use production
credentials or production database names for this smoke.

Generated module layering for app business data:

- `handler.py` dispatches only
- `service.py` orchestrates business logic and calls repo methods
- `repo.py` uses `ctx.persistence.collection(module_id, collection_name)`
- `policy.py` provides optional ownership preflight from the immutable persistence principal
- `schemas.py` defines typed shapes and pure helpers

Generated modules must not call `get_mongo_client()` directly, use `ctx.db`, or
hardcode database names. Do not generate `backend/models.py`,
`backend/database/schema.json`, or `backend/database/seed.json`.

## Implementation Rules

- Framework-owned builder artifact persistence should flow through
  `BuilderArtifactStore`, not raw collection access in workflow tools.
- App-scoped connector metadata should flow through a connector service/store,
  not raw collection access in workflow tools.
- Durable connector secrets should flow through the connector vault backend, not
  MongoDB collections or generated module code.
- Do centralize framework DB and collection names in shared runtime constants.
- Do route workflow tools through artifact-aware persistence helpers where
  possible.
- Do keep runtime state, builder artifacts, and app business data logically
  separate.
- Do keep connector metadata separate from app business collections and builder
  artifact collections.
- Do fail fast when the Studio host or the builder is launched without durable
  persistence configured.
- Do not teach workflows or docs that removed database names are canonical.
- Do not treat persistence as optional for the builder journey.
