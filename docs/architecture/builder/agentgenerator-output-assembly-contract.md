## How This Works

`InterviewAgent` emits `WorkflowInterviewResult`: `agent_message` contains the
user-facing question or confirmation, and `outcome` is `needs_input` or `ready`.
`record_workflow_interview` accepts the explicit `agent_message` argument so the
existing auto-tool event displays it in chat, checks it against the validated
output, and records the typed readiness value. Chat text and routing markers
are not readiness authority. An app without AI requirements returns `ready`
with a brief confirmation instead of asking for an invented workflow.

AgentGenerator first validates and reviews the workflow partition:

1. `PatternAgent` emits `PatternSelection`. Its tool validates the typed selection against the canonical DesignDocs workflow surface map before writing `workflows_spec`. Module pricing selections are validated by the subscription designer and AppGenerator with their data contract; AgentGenerator does not revalidate them.
2. Invalid selections return validation feedback to `PatternAgent`. Three total selection attempts are permitted per run; exhausted attempts fail rather than dispatching an invalid plan.
3. `ProjectOverviewAgent` presents `WorkflowPlanReview`. Approval, request-changes, and cancellation are structured UI responses correlated by `review_id` and the exact selection hash. Chat keywords cannot approve a plan.
4. For an approved non-empty partition, `PackBuildCoordinator` starts `workflow_generation_tasks`: one `WorkflowBundleBuilderAgent` per workflow.
5. Each worker emits `WorkflowBundleBuilderOutput` containing `CodeFile` entries. The runtime collects results in `workflow_bundle_results`, keyed by task ID.
6. `generate_and_download` validates the resulting workflow contracts before writing accepted bundles, creating the ZIP, or presenting the download UI.

Workflow features are excluded from generated pricing until workflow launch
enforces plan grants (#770). AgentGenerator rejects a saved contract that still
selects a workflow pricing feature and asks for SubscriptionContractDesigner to
rerun. Unpriced workflows continue using the workflow name capability
convention for event routing.

### Apps Without AI Workflows

An explicit `workflows: []`, `is_multi_workflow: false`, and non-empty
`pack_partition_reason` is valid when the approved design requires only modules
and pages. A missing or malformed selection is not equivalent to this decision.
Unknown surface kinds and contradictions with DesignDocs fail validation.

After the user approves an empty partition, the existing artifact recorder saves
a `workflow_bundle` build record with `workflows: []`, the correlated review,
and no workflow ZIP, primary workflow, API endpoint, or websocket endpoint.
The stage completes only after this required save succeeds. It does not run the
task batch or fabricate a workflow. Downstream AppGenerator consumes the same
explicit empty integration metadata; prior workflow hints are cleared.

Review changes return to `PatternAgent`; at most three review attempts are
allowed, with retries only after `changes_requested`. These limits are runtime
execution guards, not freemium or subscription entitlements. Cancellation,
stale approval, failed recording, and exhausted attempts fail the stage.

There are no sequential planning agents scraping MongoDB. Each `WorkflowBundleBuilderAgent` instance owns its full bundle output end-to-end.

Generated workflow bundles are staged at:

```text
$MOZAIKS_GENERATED_ARTIFACTS_PATH/workflows/{app_id}/{build_id}/{workflow_name}/
```

They do not become active runtime-loaded workflows until an explicit promotion
step copies them into an active app root's `workflows/` directory.

## Agent Roster

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `InterviewAgent` | Clarifies missing AI requirements without inventing automation |
| `PatternAgent` | Selects zero, one, or multiple workflows inside the approved design boundary |
| `ProjectOverviewAgent` | Presents the draft-correlated workflow plan review |
| `PackBuildCoordinator` | Starts the task batch for an approved non-empty partition |
| `WorkflowBundleBuilderAgent` | Task batch worker — generates all YAML and code files for one workflow bundle |
| `PackMetadataAgent` | Produces pack-level `extension_registry.json` metadata after workflow bundles complete |
| `DownloadAgent` | Triggers `generate_and_download` after pack metadata is ready |

---

## Task Batch: `workflow_generation_tasks`

Declared in `extended_orchestration/task_batches.yaml`.

```yaml
source:
  kind: context_variable
  path: workflows_spec
  task_model: WorkflowInPack
worker:
  mode: ag2_agent
  agent_field: initial_agent   # WorkflowBundleBuilderAgent
  prompt_field: initial_message
result:
  context_key: workflow_bundle_results
  status_key: workflow_bundle_status
```

Each task receives one `WorkflowInPack` entry from `workflows_spec`. Its optional
`design_surface_id` references the approved DesignDocs workflow surface.
The runtime injects it as `context_variables["structured_output"]` for the worker.

---

## WorkflowBundleBuilderOutput

The serialized YAML inside each `orchestrator.yaml` file must declare top-level
`schema_version: mozaiks.orchestrator.v1`; each `structured_outputs.yaml` file
must declare `schema_version: mozaiks.structured_outputs.v1`. The assembler
validates these document versions; the outer bundle is not their authority.

The worker emits a single `WorkflowBundleBuilderOutput` structured output:

```yaml
workflow_name: str
outcome_plans: []
files:
  - filename: orchestrator.yaml
    content: "..."
  - filename: agents.yaml
    content: "..."
  - filename: transition_graph.yaml
    content: "..."
  - filename: context_variables.yaml
    content: "..."
  - filename: structured_outputs.yaml
    content: "..."
  - filename: tools.yaml
    content: "..."
  - filename: middleware.yaml
    content: "..."
  - filename: ui_config.yaml
    content: "..."
  - filename: tools/some_tool.py
    content: "..."
  - filename: ui/index.js
    content: "..."
```

Each `CodeFile` has:
- `filename` — workflow-local relative path (e.g., `tools/save_result.py`, `ui/index.js`)
- `content` — full file content as a string

The outer structured response does not validate the YAML or Python inside
`content`. The quality gate parses all eight required workflow documents, plus
optional `a2a.yaml`, through the same schema parsers used by the runtime.
It also checks context references, transition compilation, and task-batch
contracts. Duplicate filenames, retired declarative JSON/YML variants, and
unrendered `.j2` files block export.

Declared tools must have an included Python file and matching top-level function.
Python syntax errors and unfinished tool implementations block export. Workers
must implement the tool behavior; there is no later tool-implementation stage.
These static checks do not prove arbitrary business logic or external integrations
work. Functional execution tests remain necessary for those behaviors.

`outcome_plans` is a typed list of operation plans. Each plan names `agent`,
`function`, `context_key`, `attempts_key`, `result_field`, `error_value`,
`max_attempts`, `retry_on`, and `routes: [{value, target_agent}]`. Use an empty
list only when no operation needs outcome-dependent routing. Business-specific
outcomes are allowed; every outcome must have one known destination.

`outcome_materialization.py` deterministically generates the matching tool
outcome binding, protected context definitions, and ordinary graph transitions.
Workers omit these owned context definitions and source-agent transitions from
their raw files. They still generate the operation's implementation, tool binding,
agent definition, and structured input model. Quality gates validate the
materialized files; downloads contain those files, not a runtime dependency on
Factory or its build-time plans. Hand-authored workflows use the same runtime
`tools[].outcome` contract documented in
[Workflow Authoring Contracts](../workflows/workflow-authoring-contracts.md#operation-outcomes).

---

## workflow_bundle_results Structure

After the task batch completes, `context_variables["workflow_bundle_results"]` is a dict:

```python
{
    "task_id_1": {
        "workflow_name": "StoryCreator",
        "files": [
            {"filename": "orchestrator.yaml", "content": "..."},
            {"filename": "agents.yaml", "content": "..."},
            ...
        ]
    },
    "task_id_2": {
        "workflow_name": "ReviewWorkflow",
        "files": [ ... ]
    }
}
```

Keys starting with `_` are internal meta entries and are skipped during assembly.

---

## Assembly: `generate_and_download`

Reads `workflow_bundle_results` directly from context. For each bundle entry:

1. Materialize operation plans and validate the resulting workflow contracts.
2. On failure, schedule bounded workflow repair or return to user attention.
3. `_write_bundle_to_disk(wf_name, files, base_dir)` writes accepted files under `base_dir/{wf_name}/`.
4. `_build_pack_zip(bundle_dirs, output_path)` zips the workflow directories.
5. `use_ui_tool("DownloadCenter", ...)` presents the download UI.

Assembly reads task-batch structured outputs directly from runtime context.

### Workflow Integration Metadata

During bundle assembly, `generate_and_download` derives
`workflow_integration_metadata` from each generated workflow's
`orchestrator.yaml`:

- `workflow_name`
- derived stable `capability_id`
- `workflow_startup_mode`
- event triggers from the `triggers[]` block

The normalized metadata is written back to context as:

- `workflow_integration_metadata`
- `generated_workflow_integrations`
- `generated_workflow_name`
- `generated_workflow_capability_id`
- `generated_workflow_startup_mode`
- `generated_workflow_trigger_events`

AgentGenerator persists the same metadata on the `workflow_bundle` artifact.
AppGenerator hydrates it from the latest current `workflow_bundle` artifact
before agents run, then its deterministic acceptance gate blocks export unless
the generated app wires the workflow through module capabilities, emitted
events, and `contracts/reactions.yaml`.

Smoke coverage:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_factory_artifact_lineage.py
python scripts/smoke_factory_artifact_lineage.py --real-store
python scripts/smoke_factory_artifact_lineage.py --real-store --live-agentgenerator --timeout-seconds 600
```

The first command runs the deterministic in-memory chain. The second uses the
Mongo-backed `ArtifactStore`. The third runs live AgentGenerator AG2 calls,
persists the live workflow metadata through the real artifact store, hydrates
AppGenerator from that `workflow_bundle`, and verifies app acceptance/export and
runtime loader reaction wiring.

`generate_and_download` runs the workflow bundle quality gate before download,
artifact registration, zip creation, or promotion. The gate writes
`workflow_bundle_validation_status`, `workflow_bundle_validation_errors`, and
`workflow_bundle_semantic_drift` to context. Blocking failures return
`status: blocked`; the generated bundle is not packaged.

When blocking failures map to specific workflows, `generate_and_download`
schedules a bounded repair pass instead of broad regeneration. It writes
`workflow_bundle_repair_status: needs_revision`, increments
`workflow_bundle_repair_count`, preserves the full pre-repair
`workflow_bundle_results`, narrows `workflows_spec` to the failed workflow
specs, and routes back to `PackBuildCoordinator`. Each repaired worker receives
the exact quality-gate failures in its scoped `initial_message`. After the
repair task batch completes, `WorkflowBundleMergeAgent` invokes the deterministic
`merge_workflow_bundle_repair_results` auto tool. It commits repaired workflow
outputs together with the preserved successful outputs and restores the complete
`workflows_spec` before `PackMetadataAgent` generates metadata and packaging runs
again. The merge is not a prompt hook: `workflow_bundle_results` requires an
authorized writer. Only a committed `merged` status advances to metadata; a
refused write cannot report success. After the configured attempt limit, the
status becomes `blocked` and the workflow returns to the user.

The live AgentGenerator pack smoke also emits the same `semantic_drift` report.
That report is intentionally prompt-oriented: it flags generated workflow YAML
that loads but no longer preserves the requested workflow meaning, such as event
triggers with missing `capability_id`, generic trigger descriptions, or conveyor
workflows that collapse downstream parallel work into one execution agent.
Conveyor workflows that represent heavy downstream work must declare at least
two distinct execution agents in `extended_orchestration/task_batches.yaml`;
repeating the same worker name is semantic drift. Fix those failures in
AgentGenerator prompt or structured-output contracts first, then rerun the live
smoke.

Generated workflow tools are workflow-local. Generated bundles must not reference
`workflows/_shared`, sibling workflow tool folders, or root-level shared paths.
Reusable framework-owned support code belongs under `mozaiksai.core.*`.

---

## Workflow Name and Pack Name

- `bundle_name` is derived from `context_variables["pack_name"]` if set, otherwise from the first workflow's `workflow_name`
- All names are converted to PascalCase for the output folder and zip file name

---

## Normalization Utilities in `workflow_converter.py`

`workflow_converter.py` is a contract normalization helper — it does NOT do assembly.
Functions exported:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `promote_generated_workflow(source_dir, target_root)` | Copy a generated workflow into the active workflows root |
| `_normalize_transition_rules(raw_rules)` | Normalize transition rule list; rejects LLM-evaluated conditions |
| `_normalize_tools_manifest(output, wf_logger)` | Normalize tools + lifecycle_tools with UI realization stamps |
| `_normalize_visual_agents(value, workflow_startup_mode)` | Normalize visual_agents list per workflow_startup_mode |
| `_collect_ui_code_files(output, tools_config, wf_logger)` | Collect UIFileGenerator output, skip shipped primitives, synthesize barrel |
| `_normalize_runtime_extensions(extensions, workflow_name, wf_logger)` | Keep extensions workflow-local |
| `_normalize_orchestrator_triggers(triggers, wf_logger)` | Validate trigger types against declared schema |

These are used by tests and by `WorkflowBundleBuilderAgent` implementations as reference
for what a well-formed bundle looks like.

---

## Current Boundaries

AgentGenerator's runtime path is a compact task-batch workflow:

- `PatternAgent` selects the workflow topology and AG2 network pattern.
- `ProjectOverviewAgent` presents the generated-workflow plan for review.
- `PackBuildCoordinator` triggers `workflow_generation_tasks`.
- `WorkflowBundleBuilderAgent` workers generate complete workflow bundles in parallel.
- `WorkflowBundleMergeAgent` restores the full workflow set after a repair batch.
- `PackMetadataAgent` generates pack-level routing metadata.
- `DownloadAgent` packages the generated artifacts.

Bundle assembly is context-first: generated workflow files come from
`workflow_bundle_results`, and pack metadata comes from the current structured
outputs. Runtime loading still requires explicit promotion into an active
workspace workflow root.
