# Stability and Compatibility

Mozaiks is pre-1.0. Breaking changes can still happen, but they follow a
deliberate process. This page explains the three stability tiers and how
changes are introduced so that self-hosters can plan accordingly.

---

## Three-Tier Model

### Tier 1 — Stable Public Seam

Intentionally public, covered by `test_public_framework_contract_freeze.py`
and the self-host acceptance suite. Stable within a pre-1.0 minor version.
Breaking changes require a CHANGELOG entry and a version bump.

**What is in Tier 1:**
- Module dispatch public API: `dispatch_module_action`, `ModuleActionDispatchRequest`, `ModuleDispatchScope`, `ModuleDispatchMetadata`, `ModuleDispatchAuthority`, `ModuleDispatchProvenance`, `ModuleExecutionPolicyInput`, `ModuleExecutionPolicyDecision`, `ModuleDispatchAudit`, `ModuleEventProvenance`, `ModuleReactionProvenance`, `ModuleReactionAudit`
- Platform extension contract: `PlatformExtensionBundle`, `PLATFORM_EXTENSION_SCHEMA_VERSION`
- Validation facade: `validate_generated_app_bundle`, `GeneratedAppValidationRequest`, `GeneratedAppValidationResult`, `GeneratedAppValidationDiagnostic`
- Studio scope: `StudioScope`, `resolve_studio_scope`
- App loading: `AppLoader`, `AppLoadResult`, `AppDefinition`
- Entitlement contract: `EntitlementPort`, `ConfiguredEntitlementAdapter`, `NoOpEntitlementAdapter`
- Port contracts: `AppBackendPort`, `OrchestrationPort`, `SandboxPort`
- Auth adapter protocol: `AuthAdapter`, `UserClaims`, `AuthError`
- `mozaiks_cli` entry point and documented subcommands
- All YAML contract schemas with declared `schema:` fields (`mozaiks.*.v1`)
- Package version constant: `mozaiksai.__version__`

### Tier 2 — Experimental

Public-facing but subject to change without a deprecation window. These
surfaces are working but the interface shape may still move.

**What is in Tier 2:**
- `factory_app.eval`: reference bundle scoring, corpus runs, persistence and diffs;
  import the package facade rather than its implementation modules.
- `mozaiks gen` CLI subcommand (prompt-to-app convenience; interface may simplify)
- `mozaiks context index` (app intelligence indexing; pipeline still evolving)
- `mozaiks sync-agent-guidance` (contributor tooling; format may change)
- `mozaiks migrations status` (diagnostic; schema may change)
- `mozaiks quickstart` and `mozaiks onboard` (onboarding paths; UX still being refined)
- `ConnectorVaultBackend` and all vault backend implementations (0.2.0 requires
  explicit app/workspace scope for every secret operation; older vault records
  need an operator-reviewed migration or credential re-entry)
- Telemetry and observability hooks (`AG2_OTEL_*`, `INSIGHTS_*`)
- `RUNTIME_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS` injection mechanism (hook names stable; new hooks may be added)

### Tier 3 — Internal

Not public API. May change or disappear without notice. Do not import directly.

**What is in Tier 3:**
- Everything under `mozaiksai.core.workflow.internal`
- `ExecutorRegistry` and `ExecutorType` (internal dispatch machinery)
- `ModuleLoader` internals beyond the `AppLoader` façade
- Source hygiene scan functions in `scripts/production_readiness_gate.py`
- All symbols not in `__all__` of a public package

## How We Introduce Breaking Changes (Pre-1.0)

Pre-1.0 semantics: the minor version (`0.x`) may include breaking changes.
Patch versions (`0.x.y`) are additive only.

For Tier 1 interfaces:
1. Breaking change lands in a minor bump (e.g. `0.1.11` → `0.2.0`).
2. The CHANGELOG entry uses `Changed` or `Dropped` and names the affected symbol.
3. If the replacement exists, the old path is documented in the CHANGELOG explicitly, not silently dropped.

For Tier 2 interfaces:
- May change in patch or minor bumps.
- CHANGELOG entry is provided but no deprecation window is promised.

For Tier 3 internals:
- No notice required.

## OSS Boundary Stability

The OSS/proprietary boundary is frozen.
See [ADR 0003](../adr/0003-pre-1-0-oss-proprietary-boundary-freeze.md) and
the [OSS Boundary Family Registry](../architecture/foundations/oss-boundary-families.md).

The DO-NOT-MOVE families listed in the registry will not be moved to a private
repo before 1.0. If a family is moved post-1.0, a new ADR records the decision
first.

## What Self-Hosters Can Count On Today

- `pip install -e ".[dev]"` from a clean clone works without private config.
- `mozaiks serve .` boots the platform host; `--host studio` adds the shared
  Studio management interface. Neither requires BlocUnited infrastructure.
- The clean-room self-host acceptance suite (`tests/test_selfhost_clean_install.py`) passes on every main commit.
- No runtime source imports from `mozaiks_app` (the private hosted-product repo).
- No BlocUnited domains hardcoded in runtime or factory workflow source.
- The package content guard blocks OSS wheel builds that accidentally include private artifacts.

## Version Policy

Current version: see `mozaiksai.__version__`.

The package is pre-1.0 and not yet published to PyPI. Install from a local
editable checkout. See [self-hosting guide](self-hosting.md) and
[releasing.md](../releasing.md) for the current publication status.

Do not depend on a specific pre-1.0 `0.x.y` version as a stable API target.
Pin to a specific git SHA for reproducible builds until 1.0.

### Workspace acceptance

`mozaiksai.core.validation.validate_app_workspace(app_root,
inherited_ui_roots=())` checks shared app contracts and static route/action
references. Pass the actual UI packages registered by the host when composing
Studio surfaces. It does not apply generated-file layout or placeholder policy
and is not provider/deployment readiness. Generated output continues to use
`validate_generated_app_bundle`. Both paths consume the same secret contract
and declaration checks.

Factory now explicitly declares `config/auth.yaml` and `security/secrets.yaml`.
Authenticated authored apps must supply a valid auth contract matching
`app.json.authRequired`. The shell's implicit demo fallback and copied generated
OIDC implementation are replaced by shared browser auth selected from backend
configuration. Regenerate older auth scaffolds to consume that shared adapter.
Runtime secret consumers use canonical environment handles instead of the retired
`OpenAIApiKey` and `MongoURI` lookup names; an operator vault maps its existing
secret names explicitly. See [Factory security](factory-security.md).
